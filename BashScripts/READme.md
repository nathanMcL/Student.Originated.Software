## The WSL_SystemLog.sh
This bash script is designed to run within the WSL environment.<br>Its primary function is to collect and log various system metrics to a CSV file named `WSL_os_log.csv`.<br>

## How it works

1. Checks if the `WSL_os_log.csv` log file exists. If not, it creates the file and initializes it with a header row.
2. Collects a variety of system metrics including CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, available disk space, and more.
3. Outputs a confirmation message indicating the data has been successfully logged.


## CSV File Structure
The CSV file `WSL_os_log.csv` contains the following headers:

- **OS Name**: The name of the operating system running within WSL.
- **Date Time**: The timestamp, formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.
- **CPU Usage**: The percentage of CPU utilization at the time of logging.
- **Memory Usage**: The percentage of memory usage, calculated as the ratio of used memory to total memory.
- **Disk Usage**: The percentage of disk space used on the root filesystem.
- **Available Disk**: The amount of available disk space on the root filesystem.
- **System Load Average**: Averages of the number of processes in the system run queue over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
- **Number of Processes**: The total number of processes running at the time of logging.
- **Uptime**: The total uptime of the system in seconds at the time of logging.

## Usage
To use the `WSLSystemLog.sh` script, ensure you have WSL installed and configured on your Windows system.<br> Navigate to the directory containing `WSLSystemLog.sh`,<br> then execute the script by running:

```bash
chmod +x WSLSystemLog.sh
then enter:
./WSLSystemLog.sh
```

WSL Trace Route Log

## WSL_TraceRouteLog.sh

The `WSL_TraceRouteLog.sh` script is designed to perform a traceroute to a predetermined destination and log the results in a CSV file format.<br> 
This tool is particularly useful for network diagnostics and logging, allowing users to track the route and measure transit delays of packets across an IP network.


## How it works

The script operates by executing a traceroute command to the specified destination URL or IP address.<br> It captures the traceroute output, including the number of hops, round-trip time (RTT), and the IP addresses encountered along the path.<br> This data is then parsed and logged into a CSV file.

Key steps include:
1. Checking for the existence of the log file and creating it with appropriate headers if it does not exist.
2. Performing the traceroute operation.
3. Extracting relevant data from the traceroute output.
4. Logging the extracted data to the CSV file.

## CSV File Structure

The CSV file generated by this script includes the following columns:
- **Timestamp**: The date and time when the traceroute was performed.
- **Source IP**: The IP address from which the traceroute was initiated.
- **Destination**: The predetermined URL or IP address to which the traceroute was directed.
- **Amount of Hops**: The number of hops encountered during the traceroute.
- **RTT**: The round-trip time of the final hop.
- **IP Addresses**: A list of IP addresses encountered during the traceroute.

## Usage

To use the `WSL_TraceRouteLog.sh` script, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have traceroute installed on your system. If not, you can install it using your distribution's package manager.
2. Modify the `DESTINATION` variable within the script to your target URL or IP address.
3. Run the script by entering `./WSL_TraceRouteLog.sh` in your WSL terminal.
4. Check the `traceroute_log.csv` file for the logged traceroute data.








This README provides a basic overview, details of the script's functionality,<br> the structure of the log file, and a brief guide on how to use the scripts.<br> You should adjust the file paths, URLs, and any specific instructions according to your project's setup and requirements.
