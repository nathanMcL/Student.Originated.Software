### Chpt 2

- Variables<br>
> - When examining a sequence of assignments in C, the key thing to keep in mind is that each assignment statement is processed sequentially, and each assignment overrides the previous value of the variable unless the variable is used in the expression that computes its new value.<br>
  
```
x = 7
y = 7
z = 0
x = 5
y = 5
```
- What is x, y, & z?<br>

```
 x = 5
 y = 5
 z = 0
```
