## Notes:
Wrote all code from https://github.com/TheEvergreenStateCollege/upper-division-cs/wiki/SC%E2%80%9024sp%E2%80%902024%E2%80%9004%E2%80%9008%E2%80%90Afternoon <br>

ATM 4/9/2024  ```Cargo build``` has errors. Need to work through the errors. This version is missing local Vscode dependencies.<br>

To create the file locally ```Cargo new tictactoe``` , then the additational rust dependencies will get generated within the file structure.<br>
