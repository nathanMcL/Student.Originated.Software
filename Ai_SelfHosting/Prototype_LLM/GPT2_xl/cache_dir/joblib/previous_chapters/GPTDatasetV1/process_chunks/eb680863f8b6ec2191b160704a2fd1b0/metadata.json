{"duration": 0.5971019268035889, "input_args": {"txt": "'n collective or individual\\nphysical readiness training at least three times per week.) In the H2F System, optimal participation increases\\nto 5\u20137 hours per Soldier per week and includes both physical and nonphysical training. Leaders must\\nunderstand this and make it known. A leader excuses Soldiers from H2F programming only when they have\\ncompleted exhaustive duties with little or no rest, or have temporary or permanent profiles in accordance\\nwith AR 40-501.\\n12-11. All Soldiers must understand that it is their personal responsibility to achieve and sustain a high level\\nof readiness. Many Soldiers are assigned to duty positions that restrict participation in collective unit\\nprograms. Commanders must therefore develop leadership environments that encourage and motivate\\nSoldiers to accept individual responsibility for their own readiness.\\n12-2 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Special Conditioning\\nProlonged Deployment\\n12-12. While deployed, leaders must make every effort to equip, program, permit, and lead physical\\nreadiness training. Detraining begins in as few as 14 days when Soldiers do not physically train. During post-\\ndeployment, when fitness levels may have declined, leaders must give special consideration to ensure\\nSoldiers return to or exceed their pre-deployment readiness levels. Soldiers are almost always capable of\\nrallying back to this level without needing special programming. With adequate recovery, Soldiers should\\nprepare for the ACFT within 90 days of redeployment. In cases where a deconditioned Soldier cannot meet\\nthis goal, he or she should continue to participate in the unit\u2019s regular training program, modifying the\\nintensity and frequency of training with guidance from the H2F performance team members.\\nARMY BODY COMPOSITION PROGRAM\\n12-13. The ABCP ensures all Soldiers achieve and maintain optimal well-being and performance under all\\nconditions. AR 600-9 provides the policy and procedures that apply to screening and enrollment in the ABCP.\\nAR 350-1 specifies that the ABCP will be kept separate from other special programs. Soldiers who fail to\\nmeet AR 600-9 standards are enrolled in the ABCP and continue to participate in regular unit H2F\\nprogramming. The H2F programming guides applicable modifications to Solders\u2019 nutrition and activities to\\ncreate a calorie deficit. H2F personnel review Soldiers\u2019 sleep logs and weight loss goals. Soldiers in the\\nABCP who are also recovering from injury, illness, or other medical conditions will also be in the\\nreconditioning program.\\nINJURED AND ILL SOLDIERS\\n12-14. Commanders faced with the challenge of controlling injuries while conducting rigorous training\\nmust adhere to the fundamental principles of H2F. In the H2F System, each Soldier has an individual\\nreconditioning program, written and monitored by H2F personnel in the unit. Soldiers who are reconditioning\\nwill continue to train with the rest of the unit, modifying the drills and exercises with the goal of performing\\nthem to standard and returning to full duty as soon as possible.\\n12-15. The commander\u2019s role in injury control is to lead by being present during physical training and\\nreconditioning sessions. Leader presence builds reputation and relationship with Soldiers who are working\\ntoward being mission capable. Commanders who stand in front of their formations (and not just during unit\\nformation runs) demonstrate compliance with drills and exercises. No matter their level of conditioning or\\nphysical status, commanders\u2019 presence instills pride and \u201ccan do\u201d cohesion in their formations. There ought\\nto be no gap between the commander\u2019s intent to comply with the H2F program and the commander\u2019s\\nparticipation in that program. This includes instances where leaders who are pregnant, injured, or\\ndeconditioned use H2F modified drills and exercises, and train alongside the rest of their units. Leader\\npresence during special programs de-stigmatizes injury and demonstrates support for a key part of the Warrior\\nEthos\u2014never leave a fallen comrade.\\n12-16. Precise execution of all physical training activities is essential to the injury control effort.\\nCommanders must allow trained H2F leaders the time to teach proper execution of H2F activities. H2F\\nleaders must be able to recognize and offer corrective guidance to Soldiers who have not developed the\\nmovement skills to execute drills to the standards described in ATP 7-22.02.\\n12-17. H2F schedules prescribed in this doctrine involve less sustained running than is currently performed\\nin Army units. Long runs do not have strong correlation with combat-specific physical tasks and do not\\nproperly prepare Soldiers for those tasks. This doctrine carefully balances the requirement to build strength\\nand endurance to avoid over-emphasizing any single component of readiness. A reduction in running volume\\nwill not hinder performance on two- or three-mile run assessments as long as the proper running intensity is\\nused. An increase in strength training builds the capability to sustain higher levels of endurance activity.\\n12-18. Commanders look for and resolve conflicts between the H2F schedule and the unit training schedule.\\nBy considering the physical demands of tasks on the unit training schedule, commanders can better plan\\nappropriate physical training sessions. For example, if Friday involves a 10-mile foot march to a range,\\ncommanders should not schedule speed work on Thursday. Time should be allotted for leg recovery.\\nMonday\u2019s and Wednesday\u2019s physical training should not involve Climbing Drills 1 and 2 or the Strength\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 12-3Chapter 12\\nTraining Circuit if Tuesday\u2019s unit training schedule takes the unit to an obstacle course that heavily\\nchallenges upper body strength.\\nPROFILES\\n12-19. The authorized forms for written profiles in the Army are DD Form 689 (Individual Sick Slip) and\\nDA Form 3349 (Physical Profile). DD Form 689 is the short form used to communicate to the commander a\\nSoldier\u2019s diagnosis of minimally-limiting injuries and illnesses, less than or equal to 7 days in duration. It is\\noften used to place Soldiers on 24 or 48 hour quarters. After that period has ended, healthcare providers\\ndocument the Soldier\u2019s restrictions in the Medical Readiness Portal (an electronic profile system) using\\nDA Form 3349. DA Form 3349 is the long form the healthcare provider must generate and sign electronically\\nto be valid. It provides a detailed description of the Soldier\u2019s temporary and permanent restrictions. It lists\\nmodifications to physical activities including the ACFT as well as those activities and exercises that can be\\nperformed to standard. Exercises not included on the profile are not authorized. If the unit performs non-\\nstandardized drills and exercises, the commander, healthcare provider, or both will discuss them with the\\nH2F performance team to avoid increased risk to the unit\u2019s readiness.\\n12-20. Commanders may assign Soldiers with permanent profiles to the reconditioning program or allow\\nthem to remain in unit physical training programs. A Soldier whose permanent profile only prohibits running\\nwould not be in the reconditioning program\u2014he or she would walk or use endurance training machines\\n(ETMs) when the unit performs running activities. Soldiers on convalescent leave may be exempted from\\nreconditioning at the discretion of the profiling officer. In no case can a Soldier carry a temporary profile that\\nhas been extended for more than 12 months without positive action taken to correct the problem or effect\\nother appropriate disposition in accordance with a medical review board.\\n12-21. Once a Soldier is no longer on a temporary profile and not on a permanent profile, he or she may\\ncontinue to train with assistive devices used during rehabilitation or reconditioning. These devices include\\nbraces, straps, tape, nasal strips, and other muscle- and joint-support devices prescribed or recommended by\\nthe provider or the unit\u2019s H2F performance team. Performance improvement apparel, tracking devices, and\\nother wearables are also authorized during training. As long as the performance apparel comply with AR\\n670-1 or can be worn beneath the Army physical fitness uniform (known as APFU), Soldiers do not need a\\nprofile authorizing them to be worn and used during training. These devices aim to enhance performance and\\nbuild strength and endurance to the point Soldiers no longer need assistive devices, and performance devices\\ndemonstrate higher levels of physical readiness. Assistive devices for a record ACFT are not authorized\\nunless annotated on the Soldier\u2019s permanent profile issued after a medical evaluation board.\\n12-22. Once their profiles end, Soldiers may join or continue unit-based reconditioning. Soldiers on\\ntemporary profiles will not take record ACFTs. They may train for and practice the events, but their focuses\\non healing from the injury and then training to pass the test. They will take record ACFTs once the temporary\\nprofile has ended and their command and the H2F performance team agree that they are ready.\\nINITIAL PHASE RECONDITIONING\\n12-23. Reconditioning from injury before shipping to BCT is the responsibility of the recruit.\\n12-24. Reconditioning in IMT is conducted in the FTU, commanded by a physical therapist, and often\\nincludes an organic physical therapy clinic attached. Soldiers remain in the FTU until they are capable of\\nreturning to the same phase of BCT or OSUT that they left. The FTU can also conduct ACFT improvement\\nfor Soldiers who failed to pass the test in time to graduate from BCT. The increased recovery and focused\\nphysical training permitted in the FTU results in high ACFT pass rates and successful completion of BCT. If\\nan injury is minor and only requires a few days of limitations, the Soldier receives treatment at the medical\\ntreatment facility or from healthcare providers in the unit and continues training with profile restrictions. See\\nAR 612-201 for guidance on the Warrior Training Rehabilitation Program.\\nSUSTAINING PHASE RECONDITIONING\\n12-25. Executing reconditioning programs is problematic in units with a large population of Soldiers who\\nhave profile limitations, few personnel to administer the program, and limited access to equipment and\\n12-4 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Special Conditioning\\nfacilities to comply with profile recommendations. In the sustaining phase, the H2F System meets this\\nchallenge with new approaches and resources to permit individual programming. However, in locations that\\nare remote from or not yet resourced by the H2F System, leaders should tailor guidance discussed in\\nparagraphs 12-26 through 12-39 on governance, program, equipment and facilities for specific units.\\nH2F Resourced Unit\\nReconditioning for all Soldiers is individualized and Soldiers train together\\nunder the supervision of H2F personnel using H2F equipment and facilities.\\nNon-H2F Resourced Unit\\nReconditioning is supervised by designated unit personnel or medical\\nproviders using installation or non-unit-owned equipment and facilities.\\nGovernance\\n12-26. In non-H2F resourced units, consolidation of reconditioning programs at the battalion (or equivalent)\\nminimizes the administrative and logistical strain on operational unit assets. The brigade surgeon should have\\nmedical oversight of the unit reconditioning program. Battalion medical officers act as the liaisons between\\nreconditioning program leaders (RPLs) and the brigade surgeon. The military treatment facility with\\nrehabilitation services may provide a physical therapist and a physical therapy specialist as consultants to\\noversee the gym-based reconditioning program Category 1 (see paragraph 12-32). The physical therapist can\\nassist or coordinate training efforts with the RPL.\\n12-27. The medical platoon leader is the RPL, and the medical platoon sergeant is the assistant RPL. If this\\nis not possible, then the leader chooses the RPL and assistant RPL based on the following criteria:\\n\\uf06c Certified as a MFT.\\n\\uf06c Knowledgeable in the Army\u2019s H2F System.\\n\\uf06c Able to instruct all physical training activities.\\n\\uf06c Understands the regulations and processes that govern profiling (see AR 40-501).\\n\\uf06c Able to modify activities in accordance with profile recommendations.\\n\\uf06c Able to effectively interact with medical personnel to ensure that Soldiers are fully capable of\\nreturning to the unit conditioning program.\\n12-28. It is recommended that each company in the battalion provide an NCO to assist the RPL on a daily\\nbasis. These NCOs should meet criteria mentioned in paragraph 12-27 for the assistant RPL. In addition, the\\nMFT, physical therapist, or physical therapy specialist need to provide quarterly training sessions to ensure\\nunits observe proper supervision and optimal safety practices. Trained NCOs provide supervision and group\\ninstruction to Soldiers in the reconditioning program. To meet supervision requirements, at least two NCOs\\nper company are trained to conduct and supervise the reconditioning program. Units should constantly recruit\\nNCOs for the MFT Course to ensure continuity of the physical training and reconditioning programs.\\nProgram\\n12-29. The reconditioning program aims to return a Soldier to full duty as soon as possible. Group\\nreconditioning programs with governance and equipment challenges use modifications (known as mods) to\\nstandardized physical readiness drills and activities so Soldiers safely progress and comply with exercise\\nmodifications in their profiles. Using non-standardized exercises and drills confounds this approach and\\nprevents Soldiers from complying with the rehabilitation plan developed with the healthcare provider. These\\ndrills and activities, learned in the initial phase of training, include foundational movements that Soldiers\\nmust maintain throughout their career. These drills and activities are pre-habilitative and rehabilitative. For\\nreconditioning Soldiers, these drills and activities provide the best solutions in the absence of easy access to\\ncoaching or rehabilitation personnel who can devise an individual\u2019s customized program.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 12-5Chapter 12\\n12-30. Group reconditioning meets scheduling challenges and helps Soldiers avoid re-injury.\\nReconditioning that has to be performed in groups due to limitations in personnel or facility support can be\\ndelivered by profile category (see paragraphs 12-33 through 12-37). Schedules for group reconditioning are\\ndesigned to control the risk of re-injury. Weeks A and B are intended to alternate throughout a Soldier\u2019s\\nreconditioning until he or she returns to the unit\u2019s physical training program (see table 12-1, table 12-3 on\\npage 12-7, and table 12-5 on page 12-8).\\n12-31. Modified exercises are described in discussions of Preparation Drill, Recovery Drill, Conditioning\\nDrill 1, and to a lesser extent for the drills that incorporate strength training equipment. Not every possible\\nmodification can be illustrated for every injury across every exercise.\\nNote. The overarching principle for exercise modifications is that the injured Soldier should\\ncontinually attempt to perform as close to the standard as possible.\\nThis means Soldiers will perform the largest range of motion and lift the maximum amount of weight\\npossible, as well as perform as close to the correct number of repetitions and cadence as possible, without\\nhurting themselves. When a Soldier is profile-restricted from doing an exercise, the Soldier selects another\\nexercise with similar cadence and, in collective situations, performed along with the rest of the unit. This\\napproach maintains cohesion with other Soldiers, reduces the likelihood that the injured Soldier will be\\nstigmatized, and increases the likelihood of the Soldier returning to the unit\u2019s standard.\\nCategory 1: Severe Profile Restrictions\\n12-32. Entry into Category 1 is directed by the healthcare provider during the Soldier\u2019s initial visit. The\\nSoldier\u2019s program is a gym-based program that includes a mix of specific rehabilitation exercises and clinic\\nvisits. The Category 1 profile involves any body part affected by a recent severe injury such as fracture, acute\\nor severe sprains or strains, disc herniation, or recent surgeries (see table 12-1). A Category 1 Soldier may\\nbe\u2014\\n\\uf06c Using crutches, braces or a sling.\\n\\uf06c Unable to tolerate impact.\\n\\uf06c Able to use non-impact ETMs.\\n\\uf06c Able to use STMs.\\n\\uf06c Able to perform modified Recovery Drill and PMCS.\\nTable 12-1.

Units ensure adequate space and equipment are provided for the reconditioning program to\\naccommodate STMs and ETMs. In the absence of H2F equipment sets and expertise, Soldiers best execute\\nthe reconditioning program at the brigade or installation fitness facilities. Lower extremity injuries may\\nhinder a Soldiers ability to appropriately perform strength- and endurance-related activities. Units need to\\nprovide an adequate number of ETMs that offer alternative activities so as to not aggravate or continue to\\ninjure Soldiers while promoting conditioning and recovery. Sample ETMs include cycle ergometers,\\nsteppers, elliptical machines, rowing machines, rope climbers, and treadmills. Treadmills are full weight\\nbearing machines and are most appropriate for Soldiers cleared by medical personnel to begin a walk-to-run\\nprogression. Specialized treadmills that reduce weight-bearing have the potential to further speed recovery\\nand, because of their harness systems, have the advantage over conventional treadmills of eliminating the\\nrisk of falling while walking or running.\\n12-38. Pool activities such as swimming or deep-water running eliminates most weight-bearing stress. All\\nSoldiers recovering from surgery or have wounds that are still healing require a physician\u2019s clearance before\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 12-9Chapter 12\\nentering the swimming pool. Swimming laps, aqua-jogging, and aquatic exercises enable Soldiers to maintain\\nor improve cardiorespiratory fitness without putting undue stress on joints and bones. Limitations to one leg\\nor one arm are minimal deficits in a pool environment. Kick board workouts or upper body workouts allow\\nfor strenuous activity with minimal risk of re-injury to an affected limb. With enough staffing, units can\\nimplement specialized aquatics programs to work on water aerobics or deep-water running programs for non-\\nswimmers. Effective leaders plan activities that keep everyone active during group pool sessions. Even if a\\nregular pool program is not practical, leaders can schedule an occasional trip to the pool to break up the\\nroutine and provide cross training.\\n12-39. Units that must rely on installation or shared facilities should make arrangements to ensure that space\\nand STMs or ETMs are available during the time dedicated to the reconditioning program. This may require\\npolicies that restrict the use of these facilities to only reconditioning programs. Leaders might need to\\nschedule reconditioning outside typical physical training times such as after 0800 or before 1600 to best have\\ndedicated access to gym space and equipment.\\nPREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM PHYSICAL TRAINING\\n12-40. Soldiers are expected to meet strenuous physical fitness standards when they return to their jobs after\\ntheir postpartum phases have ended. A P3T program aims to help pregnant and postpartum Soldiers maintain\\nfitness throughout their pregnancies and to help them meet the physical requirements of their units\u2019 METLs,\\nas well as the standards of the ABCP and ACFT.\\n12-41. In the H2F System, pregnant Soldiers perform the majority of their special programs in the same\\nenvironments and at the same times as their units under the supervision of medical providers or exercise\\nleaders certified in P3T. When the unit trains as a whole, it maintains cohesion, reinforces performance, and\\nsustains unit readiness and retention. Sometimes multiple units consolidate P3T education classes for Soldiers\\nto establish support networks and to promote peer reinforcement on topics about pregnancy, labor and\\ndelivery, newborn babies, and parenting issues. Instructors can use classrooms in the SPRC to teach these\\nsessions while the rest of the unit performs other H2F training in the building.\\n12-42. Soldiers diagnosed as pregnant or who are recovering after their pregnancies perform physical\\nactivities directed in their pregnancy profiles up to 45 days after the end of their pregnancies. They do not\\nhave to meet the physical training goals or test standards of the unit during this time. During maternity or\\nconvalescent leave, leaders encourage Soldiers to follow at-home exercise programs. Soldiers can also attend\\nP3T while still on maternity or convalescent leave. If postpartum Soldiers pass practice ACFTs, and receive\\nclearances from their healthcare providers, they may return to unit physical training before the one-year\\nrequirement to pass the ACFT. They must submit a DA Form 4856 (Developmental Counseling Form) to\\ncomplete disenrollment from P3T.\\nNote. In the event that a Soldier\u2019s pregnancy ends before normal delivery, consult with the\\nSoldier\u2019s healthcare provider regarding participation in the postpartum phase of P3T.\\nPRECAUTIONS FOR PREGNANT SOLDIERS\\nCommanders and H2F performance team personnel must ensure that Soldiers\\nfollow these safety precautions:\\n\\uf0b7 Soldiers must have written approval from a healthcare provider that clears them\\nto exercise during pregnancy. The DA Form 3349 (specified for pregnancy) will\\nindicate if they are allowed to exercise at their own pace.\\n\\uf0b7 Soldiers are encouraged to continue to run or jog through the 2nd trimester at\\ntheir own pace.\\n\\uf0b7 Soldiers are encouraged to participate at the highest level they are comfortable\\nand at their own pace.\\n12-10 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Special Conditioning\\nPRECAUTIONS FOR PREGNANT SOLDIERS (CONTINUED)\\n\\uf0b7 Soldiers must bring water to exercise sessions and are encouraged to drink water\\nas needed.\\n\\uf0b7 Soldiers are excused to use the restroom as needed.\\n\\uf0b7 Soldiers are encouraged to consume a small amount of calories before the\\nexercise session.\\n\\uf0b7 Soldiers are allowed to modify exercises to reduce physical discomfort (such as\\nnausea, fatigue, or pain).\\n\\uf0b7 Soldiers are to be led in strength and endurance exercises at a slow pace, which\\nmay be slower than the standard slow cadence of 50 counts per minute.\\n\\uf0b7 Pregnant Soldiers will not exercise to exhaustion, breathlessness, or fatigue. If\\nSoldiers exhibit these signs, leaders coach them to decrease the intensity or to\\nstop vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, regular painful contractions, and amniotic\\nfluid leakage.\\n\\uf0b7 Pregnant Soldiers should be led in slow, deep breathing during all phases of\\nexercise to prevent them from hyperventilating.\\n\\uf0b7 Soldiers more than 20 weeks pregnant do not perform exercises lying on their\\nbacks.\\n\\uf0b7 Soldiers more than 20 weeks pregnant must use a splinting technique to support\\ntheir abdomens during all abdominal exercises.\\n\\uf0b7 Weight bearing activities (running and jogging) for pregnant Soldiers are limited\\nto 45-minutes to prevent decreased blood flow to the heart and uterus.\\n\\uf0b7 Pregnant Soldiers are not to perform activities that put them at risk of falling or\\nbeing hit in the abdomen.\\n\\uf0b7 If a Soldier less than 20 weeks pregnant falls during an exercise, she should rest\\nfor 10 minutes on her side and notify her health care provider for further\\ninstruction. If symptoms of injury exist (such as cramping, bleeding, or swelling),\\nthe Soldier should go to the emergency room. If the Soldier is more than 20\\nweeks pregnant, then she needs to seek immediate care at the medical treatment\\nfacility.\\n\\uf0b7 Pregnant Soldiers with the following symptoms are to be referred to health care\\nprovider immediately: swelling of face and hands; severe headaches; persistent\\ndizziness; chest pain; palpitations; difficulty walking due to pain, vaginal bleeding\\nor discharge; fever; or contractions that increase in intensity, frequency, or\\nduration.\\n\\uf0b7 Soldiers follow trained exercise leaders who can assist them in modifying\\nexercises to fit their pregnancy or postpartum conditions. Training is not be led\\nby other pregnant Soldiers.\\n\\uf0b7 Safe and beneficial exercises during pregnancy include walking, stationary\\ncycling, aerobic exercises, dancing, resistance exercises, stretching exercises,\\nhydrotherapy, and water aerobics.\\n\\uf0b7 The exercise session must always have at least two exercise leaders in\\nattendance who will correct exercise performance to prevent injury.\\n\\uf0b7 After 20 weeks gestation, Soldiers need modified or substituted physical training\\nactivities to accommodate physiological changes and to promote safe\\nperformance.\\n\\uf0b7 Leaders use RPE to monitor exercise intensity during pregnancy. Moderate-\\nintensity RPE of 5 to 7 is acceptable, or using the \u201ctalk test.\u201d As long as a Soldier\\ncan talk while exercising, she likely is not overexerting herself.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 12-11Chapter 12\\nPRECAUTIONS FOR POSTPARTUM SOLDIERS\\nCommanders and H2F performance personnel must\u2014\\n\\uf0b7 Administer a needs analysis or standardized postpartum questionnaire that\\nincludes questions about cesarean-section, other delivery complications, or\\nprofile limitations that will influence exercise performance.\\n\\uf0b7 Offer guidance as to the appropriate modifications required by their individual\\ncondition or limitations.\\n\\uf0b7 Recondition postpartum Soldiers who have had cesarean sections more slowly\\nand modify exercises to reduce jumping, twisting, and pulling on the abdomen.\\n\\uf0b7 Ask postpartum Soldiers if they have a separation midline between vertical\\nabdominal muscles and give guidance as to the appropriate abdominal exercises\\nbased on their condition. A Soldier with a separation of more than two fingers in\\nwidth must manually splint her abdomen during abdominal exercises.\\n\\uf0b7 Encourage Soldiers to not move or change direction quickly and to exercise at a\\nslow pace for the first 10 weeks after delivery.\\n\\uf0b7 Watch for Soldiers with pelvic pain, low back or sciatic nerve pain, difficulty\\nwalking, limping, incontinence during exercise, or with deep abdominal pain.\\nThey may need to further modify exercise performance and check with their\\nproviders for exercise restrictions.\\n\\uf0b7 Encourage frequent hydration (preferably with water). Dehydration remains a\\nconcern after pregnancy, especially for breastfeeding mothers.\\n\\uf0b7 Give postpartum Soldiers the chance to practice ACFT events and measure their\\nbody composition as part of their needs analysis and program development.\\n\\uf0b7 Progress postpartum Soldiers to unit conditioning program and use\\nreconditioning programs to do so.\\n\\uf0b7 Watch for symptoms of depression that may occur between 3 and 4 months\\npostpartum. Encourage Soldiers who exhibit symptoms to seek professional\\nassistance, and alert the Soldier\u2019s chain of command about a potential concern.\\nPREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM PHYSICAL TRAINING\\nEXERCISE SESSIONS\\n12-43. It is safe for Soldiers to continue or start most types of exercise during a normal, uncomplicated\\npregnancy. Soldiers who were very active before pregnancy or are experienced runners, for example, may be\\ncleared by medical providers to keep doing the same workouts well into their pregnancies. Physical activity\\ndoes not increase risk of miscarriage, low birth weight, or premature delivery. The benefits of exercise during\\npregnancy include the following:\\n\\uf06c Decreased risk of pregnancy-related medical complications.\\n\\uf06c Reduced back pain.\\n\\uf06c Healthy weight gain during pregnancy and healthy weight loss afterwards.\\n\\uf06c Improved maintenance of overall physical readiness and health.\\n12-44. The changes in the body during and after pregnancy drives the frequency, intensity, duration, and\\ntypes of drills and exercises performed. See table 12-8. Each physical training session should integrate\\nmultiple exercise components. During pregnancy, Soldiers deliberately limit intensity. They limit their\\nphysical fitness components to muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, and aerobic endurance.\\nExercises promote the fullest safe range of motion, balance, coordination, and healthy body composition.\\n12-12 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Special Conditioning\\nTable 12-8.

P3T sessions include three typical elements: preparation, activities, and recovery. A preparation\\nactivity called centering\u2014purposeful concentration on the base of support and changing center of mass\u2014\\nand relaxation are unique P3T activities leaders deliberately program into the Soldier\u2019s schedule. Preparation\\nand strength training should occur before endurance training. To avoid light-headedness when getting up\\nfrom the ground, standing exercises should precede sitting and floor exercises. For the same reason, pregnant\\nSoldiers do not return to the position of attention between floor exercises. They use that time to recover in\\nplace. Recovery at the end of the session safely returns the Soldier to the pre-exercise state. In pregnant\\nSoldiers, a heart rate below 100 bpm indicates that they have returned to a pre-exercise level of exertion.\\nPREPARATION\\n12-46. P3T preparation aims to get the Soldier\u2019s mind and body ready for exercise. It consists of centering,\\ncore compressions, and modified Preparation Drill. It should last approximately 15 minutes. Centering\\nfocuses on mental preparation, deep abdominal breathing, and physical balance. Soldiers can perform it\\nsitting or standing. When a profile restricts Preparation Drill exercises, Soldiers can perform other general\\nwarm up movements including walking, marching or jogging in place, dynamic stretching, or easy aerobic\\ndance steps. Soldiers focus also on core compressions on the transversus abdominis (muscle layer on sides\\nof the abdomen). They pull the belly button in and toward the spine, hold for a few seconds, and repeat for a\\nminute.\\nACTIVITIES\\n12-47. Pregnant Soldiers should plan to exercise three to five times per week for 60 to 90 minutes at each\\nsession. Microcycles of one week and mesocycles of two to four weeks allow sequential training and fit\\nneatly into the three trimesters of pregnancy and the postpartum period. Leaders can modify periodized\\ntraining cycles to accommodate the changes occurring in the pregnant Soldier\u2019s fitness and fatigue levels,\\ndirectives from medical providers, and the Soldier\u2019s motivation to train.\\n12-48. Otherwise-healthy, postpartum Soldiers resume core strengthening exercises shortly after giving\\nbirth. They may need modifications to core and hip strengthening exercises at first, but as they progress,\\nstandard movements become safe. Before resuming sit-up type exercises, Soldiers should be checked by their\\nmedical provider for rectus diastasis, a midline separation between the vertical muscles of the abdomen.\\nTwelve weeks after the pregnancy has ended, postpartum Soldiers should be able to run three times per week.\\nPostpartum Soldiers with leadership qualities should also be considered by commanders for leadership roles\\nin the P3T program.\\nRECOVERY\\n12-49. Relaxation and stress management are recovery activities that maintain a pregnant Soldier\u2019s health\\nthroughout her pregnancy and prepare her to conserve energy during labor and delivery. A quiet, comfortable,\\nand dimly lit environment with calming music can assist with mental imagery, deep breathing practice,\\nmuscle relaxation, and mindfulness practice.\\nPREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM PHYSICAL TRAINING\\nEXERCISES\\n12-50. Soldiers maintain physical fitness with P3T exercises. Each exercise may be selected for Soldiers\\nby their providers and coached in the P3T program by H2F performance specialists. Table 12-9 lists P3T\\nexercises (see ATP 7-22.02 for illustrations). Soldiers adjust the dose and range of movement based on their\\nspecific needs, level of conditioning, and trimester.\\n12-14 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Special Conditioning\\nTable 12-9. Pregnancy and postpartum physical training exercises\\nName Description\\nKegel This exercise strengthens the muscles of the floor of the pelvis. These muscles, support\\nthe contents of the pelvis and surround the birth canal. The Kegel requires expert medical\\ninstruction for beginners. Like any muscles, the muscles of the pelvic floor can be\\nstrengthened over time to reduce the chance of long-term dysfunction, pain, and\\nincontinence particularly associated with pregnancy. Three sets of 10\u201315 repetitions of\\nKegel exercises should be performed as part of a daily routine.\\nPelvic Clock This exercise strengthens and improves the control and coordination of muscles in the\\nlumbar spine and pelvic region. Often used in the treatment of low back pain, the Pelvic\\nClock exercise safely unloads the spine and maintains mobility in the joints of the lumbo-\\npelvic region. Attention should be paid to limiting how long a pregnant Soldier remains on\\nher back when performing this exercise, especially in the second and third trimesters.\\nDeep Sumo This squat is similar to other squatting exercises. This version safely prepares Soldiers for\\nSquat delivery of their babies. It challenges balance and hip mobility and prepares for a return to\\nsimilar movements with free weights in the postpartum and reconditioning periods after\\npregnancy.\\nStanding To avoid prolonged supine positions, Soldiers can use the Standing Trunk Curve exercise\\nTrunk Curve to safely engage muscles in the front of the abdomen and pelvis. It can be practiced\\nthrough the third trimester and in the postpartum period by Soldiers who have no rectus\\ndiastasis or no diastasis greater than two fingers wide. The exercise can be performed in\\na seated position to make it easier, or on hands and knees to make it harder.\\nSit-ups Modified Sit-ups, Reverse Sit-ups, and Oblique Sit-ups safely challenge the pregnant and\\n(Modified) postpartum Soldier\u2019s abdominal muscles. The Modified Sit-Up and Oblique Sit-Up\\nexercises can be practiced during the first trimester and in the postpartum period by\\nSoldiers who have no rectus diastasis (midline separation of the vertical muscles of the\\nabdomen) or no diastasis greater than two fingers wider than two fingers. Reverse Sit-\\nUps with the splinting technique are to be performed after 20 weeks of pregnancy, and by\\nany Soldier with a diastasis of more than two fingers wide.\\nFront To prepare for training and testing events, Soldiers can adapt the Front Leaning rest\\nLeaning Rest position by moving to a six-point position or by resting on their forearms with elbows bent.\\n(Modified) These static positions allow for weight-bearing through the upper body and keep the\\npregnant Soldier\u2019s abdomen safely off the ground.\\nConstructive In the Constructive Rest Position the postpartum Soldier lays on her back with hands\\nRest Position resting on her abdomen to facilitate relaxation and focused breathing.\\n(CRP)\\nPREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM PHYSICAL TRAINING\\nEDUCATION SESSIONS\\n12-51.

The information in this chapter\\ndelivers practical health advice for the domains: physical readiness, nutritional\\nreadiness, mental readiness, spiritual readiness, and sleep readiness. This chapter offers\\nways for Soldiers to reflect on their holistic health and address what they need to do to\\nimprove their readiness. This chapter provides the tactical information for whole\\nSoldier health and fitness, from the skin in and from the neck up.\\nBUILDING SOLDIER H2F READINESS\\nAttention, perception, and expectation\\nWhat Soldiers pay attention to and perceive\u2014and what they expect to happen\u2014has a\\nprofound impact on their overall health.\\n13-1. The things that Soldiers focus on tend to drive the trajectories of their lives. The more Soldiers learn\\nto pay attention to their health and fitness, the more dramatic and positive their improvements in readiness\\nwill be. Soldiers are capable of creating new pathways in their brains that will change their ways of reacting,\\ndeciding, and behaving.\\n13-2. In organizations where positive lifestyle choices are valued and encouraged, those member more often\\nmake the right choices. When Soldiers learn to focus on positive events, they more likely overcome the\\nnegative, which all of us tend to find first. In successful teams, supervisors give three times as much positive\\nfeedback as negative feedback.\\n13-3. Soldiers have their own unique perspective formed by personal experiences, histories, and education.\\nChanging perspectives requires deliberate hard work on the part of Soldiers, their leaders, and the\\nperformance readiness experts in the H2F System. Focusing on specific health behaviors can impact a\\nSoldier\u2019s perspective. This section of the doctrine directs holistic health coaching, teaching, and mentoring.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 13-1Chapter 13\\nHOLISTIC HEALTH\\n13-4. While certain behaviors make a huge impact on holistic health, Soldiers will have challenges in\\ndifferent areas. The specific health behaviors associated with optimal health are\u2014\\n\\uf06c Eat vegetables and fruit.\\n\\uf06c Exercise.\\n\\uf06c Avoid tobacco use.\\n\\uf06c Avoid excessive alcohol consumption.\\n\\uf06c Sleep.\\n\\uf06c Take medication only prescribed by your provider.\\n13-5. The domains of readiness in this doctrine cover these behaviors and much more. Soldiers have many\\nchoices and large potential to achieve optimal health and fitness. Figure 13-1 lists these areas.\\nFigure 13-1. Circle of health\\n13-6. To help Soldiers take stock of where they stand on the circle of health, the personal health inventory\\n(PHI) has been developed. A completed PHI gives the Soldier and H2F performance team a full picture of\\nwhat really matters in the Soldiers\u2019 lives, what they intend to use health for, what brings them joy and\\nhappiness, and what their vision is of their best possible health and fitness. Table 13-1 gives the overview of\\nthe PHI. The PHI can be taken at a time to be determined.\\n13-2 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Holistic Health and Fitness Coaching\\nTable 13-1. Personal health inventory components\\nComponent Examples\\nWhat really matters? Identified values, mission, aspirations, and purpose\\nWhat is going right Assets\\nalready?\\nGoals SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, time-specific)\\nMindful awareness Focus on what is important\\nSelf-care Food and drink; recharge; personal development; family, friends and\\ncolleagues; power of mind, spirit and soul; and working the body\\nProfessional care Prevention, illnesses, referrals, screening, complementary approaches\\nCommunity Resources, team members\\nNext steps Follow-up, support\\n13-7. Mindfulness is paying attention, on purpose and without judgment, to the present moment. Mindful\\nawareness or mindfulness is a key component of cultivating presence\u2014paying attention or being aware of\\nthe moment\u2014and it is essential for H2F. Unless Soldiers pay attention or take notice, they cannot change or\\ngrow. Learning to focus on one thing for a period often contradicts normal behavior. When the mind is too\\nfull of thoughts, it cannot focus in the present moment. The objective is to be mindful.\\n13-8. Everyone has the capacity to be mindful. It is a natural capacity to pay attention with curiosity and\\nopenness. Simple examples include enjoying a cup of tea or coffee, watching the sunset, savoring a favorite\\nfood, or noticing the details of driving home from work. Soldiers use some techniques, like meditation, to\\nfoster mindful awareness, but mindful awareness is really about an overall approach that goes wherever the\\nSoldier goes. Mindfulness involves tuning in with personal thoughts and practicing awareness of\\nrelationships with these thoughts.\\n13-9. Practicing mindfulness and other forms of meditation has many health benefits. Changes in brain\\nactivity appear after a few weeks of mindfulness practice. Other physiological changes are associated with\\nincreased relaxation, improved focus, reduced inflammation, lower stress hormones, and enhanced immune\\nsystem function. For healthy Soldiers, changes can include reduced stress, anxiety, depression, anger and\\ndistress; improved quality of life, higher emotional intelligence, creativity and concentration; and increased\\nempathy, spirituality, and self-compassion.\\n13-10. For those Soldiers with health issues, mindfulness can ease chronic pain, decrease high blood\\npressure, and calm stress hormones and inflammatory processes. It can help with smoking cessation,\\ndecreasing binge eating and substance abuse, and reducing sleep difficulties.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 13-3Chapter 13\\nMindfulness Training Exercise\\nSit comfortably with the feet planted firmly on the floor. Lengthen your body through\\nyour back, neck, and the top of your head. For the next two minutes, turn all of your\\nawareness to your breathing. Without changing the rate or quality of your breathing,\\nsimply note the sensation of inhalation, the sensation of exhalation, and the pauses\\nbetween these two.\\nNow reflect:\\nHow easy was it to focus your attention on your breathing for two straight minutes?\\nWhat distracting thoughts arose?\\nWhat judgments or evaluations pulled your awareness away from your breathing?\\nTake two additional minutes to repeat the exercise above. This time, when your\\nthoughts wander away from the breath, gently return your attention to your breathing.\\nJudgments may arise\u2014\u201cI can\u2019t concentrate,\u201d or \u201cThis is boring.\u201d When this happens,\\nsimply notice that this is a thought and bring your attention back to your breathing.\\nWhen your mind wanders, be gentle with yourself. Notice if you scold yourself for\\ndeviating from the breath, accept the passing distraction, and focus your attention back\\non the breath.\\nNow reflect again:\\nHow did it feel taking an additional two minutes to focus on the breath?\\nHow easy or difficult was it to maintain your attention on the breath?\\nWhat distracting thoughts and judgments arose?\\nHow easy or difficult was it to gently bring your awareness back to your breathing?\\nHow do you feel at the end of this exercise?\\nIf you found it challenging to maintain present-moment awareness of the breath during\\nthe last exercise, take heart; the body is a constant ally in remaining grounded in the\\nhere and now. Your body feeds you constant updates about your experience of the\\npresent moment. Observe your breathing. Note the feeling of your feet on the floor.\\nWhat signals are arising from your body\u2014hunger, thirst, fatigue, discomfort, the need\\nto go to the bathroom? What are you seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching? In\\nbringing the awareness to these ongoing status indicators, we are able to maintain\\npresence in the current moment.\\nNow reflect again:\\nHow is this way of paying attention different from how you normally pay attention?\\nHow might this way of paying attention have an effect on your health?\\nPROACTIVE HEALTH\\n13-11. Proactive health refers to taking charge of physical, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing to control and\\nminimize potential health hazards. As opposed to reactive health that focuses on a response to a hazard,\\nproactive health requires a disciplined approach to managing all aspects of health\u2014from exercise, to diet and\\nnutrition, spirituality, and behaviors\u2014in a preventative mode. The H2F System is designed to account for\\nthe multitude of factors that influence health from a preemptive standpoint.\\nPHYSICAL EXERCISE\\n13-12. Regular participation in exercise helps to decrease disease risk and in most cases is beneficial\\nbehavior that helps when treating diseases and symptoms. Beside daily physical training, Soldiers who tend\\nto have less physically demanding MOS- or work-related duties should incorporate physical activity\\n13-4 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Holistic Health and Fitness Coaching\\nthroughout the day. Taking movement breaks every hour or performing Stability and Movement Drills during\\ncomputer breaks, walking outside parking farther away, and taking the stairs all provide feasible ways to get\\nmore movement throughout the day and thus decrease sedentary time.\\n13-13. The health benefits of activity are significant and numerous. They include lower all-cause mortality\\nrates; increased life span; prevention of cardiovascular disease, cancer (colon and breast), type II diabetes,\\nhigh blood pressure, and obesity. Exercise reduces the negative effects of aging, reduces dementia, and\\nenhances brain function. Cognitive benefits of exercise include improved concentration, memory, and mental\\nagility. Increasing physical activity decreases symptoms of depression and anxiety and improves\\npsychological well-being.\\nSURROUNDINGS\\n13-14. A Soldier\u2019s surroundings include the home, workplace, neighborhood, emotional network, climate,\\necology, and healthcare environment where a Soldier goes to heal or prevent illness. Surroundings can\\nsignificantly impact the way Soldiers feel as well as their health outcomes. For example, a messy desk\\ncluttered with paper and used cups can stress some people. And a walking into a tidy clean space can\\ninvigorate some people to focus quickly on a task.\\n13-15. In the study of epigenetics\u2014how genes are expressed\u2014the expression of genetic traits is linked to\\nthe environment. The possibilities for how biological, psychological, and social phenomena interact and how\\ndifferences in environment might affect health are practically endless. However, if surroundings can cause\\nchanges in health, modifying the surroundings can also influence H2F goals.\\n13-16. Changes to the environment and lifestyle do not have to be complicated or expensive. For example,\\nusing darker curtains, a sleep mask, or earplugs can aid sleep; while re-painting a room a brighter color or\\nspending more time in nature can improve mood. Bringing a plant inside a home can improve indoor air\\nquality and even the aesthetic appeal of a room. Other methods to change environment can include\u2014\\n\\uf06c Asking smokers to move outside (or cut back).\\n\\uf06c Cleaning the house using safe household products.\\n\\uf06c Using a water filter.\\n\\uf06c Placing weapons in locked boxes.\\n\\uf06c Keeping cords and obstacles out of the way.\\n\\uf06c Increasing consumption of fresh vegetables and fruit instead of processed convenience foods.\\nPERSONAL DEVELOPMENT\\n13-17. Soldiers often think of work-related development as the way to forge a successful professional life.\\nDeveloping a life outside professional spheres\u2014personal development\u2014balances work and play to provide\\nmore energy for professional success. Personal development includes hobbies, interests in art and music,\\nvolunteering, personal reading, and other sources of inspiration that help Soldiers to find their potential.\\nPersonal development might encompass or include improving financial health, spending time with friends\\nand family, practicing forgiveness and gratitude, or committing random acts of kindness. These activities\\nimprove self-awareness and identity, build social capital, nurture positive emotions, and cultivate hope and\\noptimism.\\n13-18. Meaningful activities for personal development are nearly infinite, but the impact of volunteering\\non holistic health is worth particular attention. Of those who volunteered over a 12-month period, a study by\\nUnited Health Group published in 2013 found that 76 percent reported feeling healthier, 94 percent reported\\nimproved mood, 78 percent reported lower stress levels, 96 percent reported enriched sense of purpose in\\nlife, and 80 percent reported feeling control over health.\\nNUTRITION\\n13-19. The sheer number of resources and suggestions available for advice on nutrition make it imperative\\nfor Soldiers to work in conjunction with the H2F performance team\u2019s registered dietitian. In the absence of\\n8 October 2020 FM 7-22, C1 13-5Chapter 13\\na dietitian, the following guidelines, fleshed out with the information in Chapter 8, \u201cNutritional Readiness,\u201d\\nprovide a rational approach for leaders:\\n\\uf06c Eat breakfast. Front-load calories during the day\u2014eat most calories earlier rather than later.\\n\\uf06c Don\u2019t skip meals or snacks.\\n\\uf06c Cut back on caffeine.\\n\\uf06c Drink more water and limit consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages.\\n\\uf06c Limit eating out and bring a healthful lunch to work.\\n\\uf06c Eat more fruits and vegetables. The more color on your plate, the better.\\n\\uf06c Eat slowly and mindfully focusing on food rather than on screens; limit screen time during meals.\\n\\uf06c Be realistic and make small changes over time.\\n\\uf06c Be sensible and enjoy all foods in moderation.\\nRECHARGE\\n13-20. As discussed in the chapter 11, Soldiers need to maintain a well-balanced sleep-wake schedule for\\noverall health. Disruption of this schedule promotes chronic fatigue and the onset and progression of illness.\\nFor those with less than 5 hours of sleep per night versus those with greater than 7 hours of sleep, there is an\\nincreased risk of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, heart attack, and stroke.\\n13-21. Recharging does not just include sleep. Energy levels can be positively impacted by vacations, rest\\nperiods, and breaks at work. Taking time for leisure, creativity, and hobbies or other non-work interests can\\nrestore energy levels. The break from work does not have to be a long one for restored energy to happen.\\nFAMILY, FRIENDS, AND COLLEAGUES\\n13-22. A Soldier\u2019s support network is perhaps the single most important variable in determining his or her\\nphysical and emotional health. The stress hormone, cortisol, does not increase as much in stressful situations\\nwhen people have supportive companions nearby. A simple hug from a friend or family member can be a\\nstress-buffer, alleviating fears and increasing positive feelings. When contact activates the skin\u2019s sensory\\nreceptors, the hormone oxytocin\u2014the one that makes people feel good\u2014is stimulated and cortisol is reduced.\\n13-23. Soldiers have many ways to enhance social connections and relationships. The following list is by\\nno means exhaustive but includes many simple ways for Soldiers to improve their support network:\\n\\uf06c Consider joining a health group, sports team or workout group.\\n\\uf06c Become more active in the community through volunteering.\\n\\uf06c Make sure to have a confidant to turn to.\\n\\uf06c Connect with a significant other.\\n\\uf06c Connect with animals. Heal or avoid negative relationships.\\n\\uf06c Cultivate communication skills.\\n\\uf06c Work with H2F performance team experts to build coping skills.\\n\\uf06c Practice being compassionate to and thankful for others.\\n+ SPIRIT\\n13-24. Chapter 10 discusses spiritual readiness. It outlines ways that Soldiers and their leaders can\\nencourage individual spiritual readiness and development. When Soldiers seek a sense of meaning or purpose\\nin their lives, they can take practical actions toward that goal. For example, Soldiers can write in a journal to\\nanswer questions about what spirit means to them. They can pray, meditate, join a spiritual community, or\\nconnect with a chaplain or chaplain service. Some of the demonstrated benefits include\u2014\\n\\uf06c Coping: religiosity and spirituality can help people cope with many problems including anxiety,\\nchronic pain, addiction, mental disorders, and the stress caused by natural disasters and war.\\n\\uf06c Pain control: Many people pray as a method to cope with pain. Prayer is a positive resource for\\nreducing pain and improving well-being and mood. Accessing religious and spiritual resources\\n13-6 FM 7-22, C1 8 October 2020Holistic Health and Fitness Coaching\\ndecreases arthritis pain, chronic pain, migraines, and acute pain. Often, it seems that it is not that\\nthe pain level is decreased so much as that a person\u2019s ability to tolerate the pain is improved.\\n\\uf06c Mental health benefits: incorporating religious and spiritual perspectives into Soldiers\u2019 lives can\\ndecrease their risk of posttraumatic stress, major depressive disorder, alcohol-related problems,\\nand suicidal ideation.\\n\\uf06c Health benefits: religious people smoke less, exercise more, and have a healthier diet.\\nPOWER OF THE MIND\\n13-25. What Soldiers think and believe about themselves strongly affects what they can achieve physically.\\nThe H2F approach treats the Soldier\u2019s physical and mental readiness as requiring equal amounts of attention.\\nIn fact, it regards them as inseparable.\\n13-26. Examples of the power of the mind are well known. In the 1940s, Henry Beecher found that saline\\ninjections with no medicinal potential reduced pain for wounded Soldiers. He coined the term \u201cplacebo\\neffect\u201d to describe the phenomenon. In the 1970s, Herbert Benson began to study what he described as the\\n\u201crelaxation response\u201d\u2014the body\u2019s natural state of relaxation\u2014and how this response can be activated\\nthrough the mind. Study participants who use mind-body practices experience genetic and molecular changes\\nnot experienced by people in study control groups.\\n13-27. The field of psychoneuroimmunology studies the relationship among the nervous system, the\\nimmune system, and the endocrine system. Thoughts and emotions have a measurable biochemical effect\\nand can change the body chemistry. Neuroplasticity research demonstrates that the nervous system can\\nchange in response to the environment, personal behaviors, and the natural world. Even brains undergo\\nconstant changes. For example, parts of the brain can shrink in response to chronic pain, and those same parts\\ncan regrow with the use of mind-body techniques such as meditation and cognitive behavioral therapy\u2014\\ntherapy focused on changing behaviors by modifying thoughts in a positive way.\\n13-28. Some mind-body practices do not require referral for clinical or professional intervention. These\\npractices can include art therapies such as music, visual arts and dance. They also include autogenic training\\nand other forms of self-hypnosis, biofeedback devices that measure physiological activity such as heart rate\\nmonitors. Lastly, mind-body practices include breathing exercises, imagery, journaling, meditation, and\\nprogressive muscle relaxation.\\nH2F Coaching\\nDelivering improved readiness system in H2F requires a new paradigm of coaching,\\nteaching, and mentoring and contemporary performance readiness content. This\\ncontent integrates and condenses the domains of H2F into tactics, techniques, and\\nprocedures that represent a culture shift for the Soldier: skin in, neck up\\n8 October 2020 FM 7-22, C1 13-7This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 14\\nHolistic Health and Fitness Schedules\\nH2F training schedule development is a complex process. This chapter directs the\\nprogramming and provides template examples of how H2F is delivered.\\nINCORPORATING H2F TRAINING\\n14-1. Multiple variables impact the ability to apply one training schedule as a standard approach across all\\nof the Army. These variables include the length of the training cycle, time until operational, time until\\ndeployment, cadre to Soldier ratios, shift work, availability of the H2F performance team, equipment and\\nfacilities, MOS-specific training, and environmental (austere, hot, cold, and seasonal) considerations.\\n14-2. The H2F System addresses these constraints by expanding the time required to conduct readiness\\ntraining. Army physical readiness training will continue to occur at least 5 to 6 times per week for a total of\\nfive to 7.5 hours. The H2F System supplements this training with approximately 2 to 4 more hours per week\\nof scheduled training in the SPRC. The expanded H2F training time permits more individual physical and\\nnonphysical programming. For example, BCT will emphasize more active recovery and strength training. It\\nwill assess, group, and train Soldiers by ability for both endurance and strength activities. Both initial and\\nsustaining phase activities will continue to include training on free weights and occupational tasks such as\\nfoot marches with progressive intensity and frequency across more arduous terrain, greater distances, and\\nheavier loads than previously. The length of the training cycle, MOS requirements, and mission-essential\\ntasks will determine how leaders insert these activities into the H2F schedule.\\nINITIAL PHASE\\n14-3. The initial phase of H2F training refers to the physical and nonphysical activities Soldiers perform\\nupon entering the Army. Initial phase training is meant to indoctrinate and condition Soldiers to the rigors of\\nlife in the Army. These activities begin at varying degrees from recruitment, continuing through basic and\\nAIT, and up to the FUA. Soldiers are taught to use the proper uniforms and procedures to prevent injuries\\nunder different environmental conditions, as well as techniques to maximize the benefits of nutrition,\\nspiritual, and sleep protocols.\\nFUTURE SOLDIER PROGRAM\\nRECRUIT TRAINING\\nRecruit training should not be started until the individual or recruit has\\npassed a routine physical examination at a military entrance processing\\nstation.\\n14-4. Commanders in charge of preparing individuals and recruits for the physical demands of IMT have\\ncertain considerations. The program outlined in this chapter specifies the physical intensity, duration, and\\nfrequency of training. For the program to be safe and effective leaders need to follow it as written. Soldiers\\nneed to conduct exercise regularly at the proper intensity to bring about desired changes in the body. Changes\\nin the body occur gradually. If Soldiers miss a whole week of physical training, then starting the week over\\nis better than pressing on too soon. In addition to the physical training programming, leaders need to teach\\nand follow information on the other H2F domains, particularly sleep and nutrition, to recruits.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 14-1Chapter 14\\nGETTING STARTED\\n14-5. The physical training program begins with the recruiter assessing the physical condition of the recruit.\\nA recruiter administers the OPAT, which consists of the Standing Long Jump, Seated Power Throw, Strength\\nDeadlift, and Interval Aerobic Run. Graders record OPAT scores on DA Form 7888 (Occupational Physical\\nAssessment Test Scorecard). This assessment determines the recruit\u2019s starting point and appropriate\\nplacement into the FSP. The recruiter and the recruit review the scores on each event to determine which\\ntraining schedule the recruit will follow: strength schedule or endurance schedule.\\n14-6. Serious recruits commit up to 60 minutes per day to physical training four or five days per week.\\nWhether recruits start with the walk to run program or begin at a higher level, their programs will improve\\ntheir health and prepare them for the requirements of OPAT or IMT.\\nSAFETY\\n14-7. The FSP physical training program is a safe and effective way to improve physical fitness. Consistent\\ncompliance with the following guidelines is the key:\\n\\uf06c Always perform the prescribed warm-up and cool-down before and after the training activity.\\n\\uf06c Perform only the prescribed number of sets and repetitions on the training schedule.\\n\\uf06c Use proper form (precision) with fewer repetitions rather than poor execution with more\\nrepetitions.\\n\\uf06c Perform all the exercises in the order listed for each drill.\\n\\uf06c If a day of training is missed, pick up with the next day on the training schedule.\\nINJURY CONTROL\\n14-8. Injuries are not uncommon during physical training, but recruits can prevent most injuries. Many\\ncommon injuries are caused by misuse\u2014making a mistake in the amount of the exercise or in not following\\nthe standard way to perform it. The most common injuries occur in the feet, ankle, and knee joints and leg\\nmuscles. Recruits can avoid most injuries by paying deliberate attention and concentrating on the details of\\nthe exercise\u2014the standard for the movements. Most injuries can be best treated with rest. Ice, compression\\nand elevation of the injury may help with pain control. Leaders must report all accidents resulting in injury\\nor illness in accordance with AR 385-10.\\n14-9. A holistic approach to injury control requires proactive behavior on the part of the recruit. Recruits can\\ncontrol injuries by following discussion in paragraphs 14-10 through 14-14. It outlines considerations that\\nrecruits can use to improve their health and fitness.\\nShoes\\n14-10. Recruits should choose an athletic shoe that is comfortable\u2014fits properly and is new. Most local\\nArmy training centers permit recruits attending BCT to wear personally procured shoes in FSP and for OPAT.\\nShoes should conform to the design of the Army-issued athletic shoe. They must be durable and appropriate\\nfor different activities besides running (jumping, turning, climbing, crawling, walking, and weight lifting),\\ndifferent terrains (grass, sand, blacktop, trails, woodland, tracks, and gym floors), and various weather\\nconditions (snow, ice, rain, intense heat, and cold). Minimalist-style running shoes might not provide\\nprotection and traction in inclement weather and on unimproved terrain such as gravel, roots, dirt, and mud.\\nNutrition\\n14-11. Recruits learn that proper nutrition plays a major role in attaining and maintaining physical fitness\\n(see chapter 8 on nutritional readiness). Good dietary habits greatly enhance overall ability to maximize\\npotential in both physical and nonphysical performance. A good diet quality facilitates psychological\\nresilience in young adults. Successful recruits can eliminate highly processed, high-fat, and high-sugar foods\\nin favor of nutrient-dense choices, following this guidance:\\n\\uf06c Bread, cereal, rice, and pasta: Try to make at least half of these choices whole-grain products, such\\nas 100 percent whole grain bread, brown rice or wild rice, barley, or oatmeal.\\n14-2 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Holistic Health and Fitness Schedules\\n\\uf06c Vegetables: Eat a variety\u2014the more color on the plate, the better\u2014at least 3 to 5 a day, especially\\ndeep green types and the red, yellow, and orange varieties.\\n\\uf06c Fruit: Eat all varieties\u2014at least 2 a day. Try to have a citrus fruit or juice (for example, orange or\\ngrapefruit) plus a blue, red purple, or orange type (for example, blueberries, strawberries, plums,\\nor peaches) every day.\\n\\uf06c Milk, yogurt, and cheese: Select low fat milk or cottage cheese, low fat yogurt, and low fat cheeses.\\n\\uf06c Meats, poultry, fish, eggs, beans: Choose lean meats, (round or loin), skinless chicken or turkey\\nbreast, ham, fish, or seafood (not fried or battered), egg whites, and bean burgers.\\n\\uf06c Fats, oils, nuts: Add a little, but use in moderation. Cut back on fried, greasy, oily or creamy, and\\nbuttery foods. Use nut butters with no added sugar and eat nuts in small amounts.\\n\\uf06c Sugar: Avoid added sugar and eliminate nutrient poor foods like candy, dessert, and sugary drinks.\\n\\uf06c Supplements: Eat whole, real foods before choosing to take vitamins or other supplements that\\nmay not have the nutrient profile and benefits claimed by the manufacturer.\\nHydration\\n14-12. Leaders provide water for hydration before, during, and after physical training activity in the FSP.\\nRecruits drink 13 to 20 ounces of cool water at least 30\u201360 minutes before exercise. After the activity, they\\ndrink to thirst. At all times, recruits need to limit alcoholic beverages and soft drinks; they avoid these drinks\\nafter exercise as they are not suitable for proper hydration and recovery. Recruits may consume sports drinks.\\nHowever, they may also need to consider that sports drinks contain additional calories. Throughout the day\\nleaders encourage recruits to drink to thirst, approximately 8\u201310 glasses of water per day.\\nHYPONATREMIA\\nIt is possible to drink too much water and become overhydrated or\\nhyponatremic. Be sure to limit intake to no more than 1\u00bd quarts\\nper hour (48 ounces) during sustained exertion.\\nClothing\\n14-13. Leaders ensure that the clothing is comfortable for the climate and bright or reflective enough for\\noutdoor activity conducted in the dark on roadways or sidewalks. Recruits should never wear rubberized or\\nplastic suits, facemasks, or other restrictive breathing devices during exercise or physical assessments.\\nPersonal audio devices and earphones are appropriate for indoor activity. Leaders discourage these devices\\nfor outdoor activity where they can reduce situational awareness and increase the risk of injury from other\\npedestrians and traffic.\\nHeat and Cold\\n14-14. Recruits avoid exercising in extreme hot or cold weather. Leaders try to find alternate indoor\\nlocations\u2014schools, military Morale, Welfare, and Recreation facilities, community recreation centers, or\\ncommercial fitness facilities\u2014to reduce the risk of heat or cold injuries. Recruits also avoid exercising near\\nheavily trafficked streets and highways during rush hours. Leaders should check the air pollution index for\\nthe local area to avoid exposure to air pollution.\\nHEAT AND COLD INJURIES\\nIf recruits experience any of these symptoms, immediately stop the\\nphysical activity and seek appropriate medical attention:\\n\\uf0b7 Heat cramps: muscular twitching, cramping, or muscular\\nspasms in the arms, legs, or trunk.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 14-3Chapter 14\\n\\uf0b7 Heat exhaustion (requires medical attention): excessive thirst,\\nfatigue, lack of coordination, increased sweating, cool or wet\\nskin, dizziness, confusion, or combination of symptoms.\\n\\uf0b7 Heatstroke (medical emergency, dial 911): no sweating, hot dry\\nskin, rapid pulse, rapid breathing, dizziness or confusion,\\nunconsciousness, seizure, or coma.\\n\\uf0b7 Hypothermia: shivering, loss of judgment, slurred speech,\\ndrowsiness, or muscle weakness.\\n\\uf0b7 Frostbite: white or greyish-yellow skin color, skin that feels\\nunusually firm or waxy, or numbness in body parts exposed to\\nthe cold\u2014usually the ears, nose, feet, and hands.\\nPHYSICAL TRAINING SESSION\\n14-15. In untrained recruits, improvement in physical readiness is much greater and more rapid, relatively\\nspeaking, than those with advanced levels of fitness. Because of this, low-load and low-volume strength and\\nendurance programs can produce substantial improvements. FSP physical training sessions follow this\\nprinciple. Leaders can increase volume for trained recruits so long as they continue to follow the RPE\\nguidelines in the FSP weekly templates (see table 14-1). For strength training, if recruits can complete two\\nrepetitions over the repetition goal for an exercise for two consecutive workouts, they can increase the weight\\nby five to ten percent for the next strength session.\\nTable 14-1.

The physical training session consists of three elements\u2014preparation, activity, and recovery. These\\nelements combine to meet the recruit\u2019s training goal. That goal might be to improve OPAT scores, improve\\nmuscular strength, or improve anaerobic power. The recruiter identifies a component of fitness that needs\\nimprovement, and the recruit then trains that component during that specific physical training session.\\n14-17. The length of the physical training period prior to shipping to IMT varies. If recruits have only a few\\nweeks available to train and know from the outset, then one micro cycle of periodized training will be\\npossible. If more time is available, perhaps 60 to 90 days for a Regular Army recruit and 180 days for a\\nNational Guard recruit, they can complete a progressive mesocycle of training. Recruits will be encouraged\\nto do their best. They will be instructed on the RPE scale and how to apply that to each session. Each session\\nand week in the FSP builds on the previous one, using OPAT improvement and other exercises that prepare\\nthe recruit for BCT. If a session is missed, the recruit moves on to the next one. If a week is missed, the\\nrecruit has to go back to complete that week. Weekly self-assessments of strength and endurance exercises\\nand activities give the recruit and the recruiter reassurance that they are making progress.\\n14-18. The initial part of this cycle includes light muscular endurance activities and the improvement of\\nmovement skills. These activities reduce muscle soreness and improve trunk and limb flexibility. Awareness\\nof proper form while learning new movements will be paramount. This stage usually lasts up to four weeks\\nand depends on recruits\u2019 adaptation to exercise and their projected date to ship to training. The main activity\\nduring this initial stage begins with 15-20 minutes and may progress to 60 minutes. Goals set by the recruiter\\nwill drive the frequency, intensity, total time, and type of exercises performed. Sets and repetitions will\\nincrease to provide enough stimulus for continuous improvement.\\n14-19. As fitness improves, recruits should also improve in strength and endurance while their tolerance of\\nintensity and duration increases. Once they meet their initial goals, and if time allows, the recruiter repeats\\nassessment or proficiency in drills and exercises and may establish new goals. Otherwise, the recruits\\nmaintain their program at levels similar to the BCT schedule to reduce the risk of injury when they arrive at\\nBCT. Injury control is the secondary effect of proper conditioning. The primary effect is physical readiness.\\nPreparation\\n14-20. Preparation exercises prepare the body for the more vigorous activity planned for the main portion\\nof exercise session. Preparation should be dynamic\u2014involve movements of all the joints in multiple\\n14-6 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Holistic Health and Fitness Schedules\\ndirections, positions, and planes of motion\u2014and conducted at a controlled slow or moderate cadence (50 or\\n80 counts per minute). Cadence and repetitions depend on the recruits\u2019 fitness. Cadence does not exceed\\nmoderate cadence and includes no more than 10 repetitions of any single 4-count exercise. On training days\\nthat include more focus on upper body strength and mobility, recruits perform Four for the Core and the\\nShoulder Stability Drill followed by Conditioning Drill 1. Recruits perform five 4-count repetitions of each\\nof the stability and conditioning drills. On training days that focus on endurance and mobility, they perform\\nthe Preparation Drill warm-up followed by the Hip Stability Drill. Recruits may modify the exercises until\\nthey can perform them to standard. See ATP 7-22.02 for exercise modifications for Preparation Drill and\\nConditioning Drill 1.\\nActivities\\n14-21. Activities in the FSP are specified on the physical training schedule. See also physical training\\nschedules for BCT in table 14-6 on page 14-10 and for AIT in table 14-9 on page 14-21.\\nRecovery\\n14-22. Recovery serves to gradually slow the heart rate and helps prevent pooling of the blood in the legs\\nand feet after recruits have completed the most rigorous exercises. Recruits begin the cool down by walking\\nuntil their heart rates return to less than 100 bpm and heavy sweating stops. The cool down should last\\napproximately 10 minutes and occur immediately after recruits complete the main activities. The Recovery\\nDrill provides exercises designed to improve flexibility in most of the joints and reduce tightness of the\\nmuscles in the body. These static stretches involve slowly stretching muscles and then holding that position\\nfor an extended period of up to 30 seconds.\\nOPAT IMPROVEMENT\\n14-23. Some recruits need to make improvements to pass the OPAT. Table 14-2 lists OPAT improvement\\nportions in the FSP schedule. These exercises help recruits with limited physical training experience to\\nprepare for the OPAT. These exercises help develop strength, endurance, and movement skills using common\\nstrength training methods and practices. The sequence of each training session is the same as the FSP\\nschedules: preparation, activities, and recovery. OPAT candidates with very limited running experience must\\navoid running on consecutive days to prevent injuries. Table 14-2 lists the top three or four specific exercises\\nto improve performance on each OPAT event.\\nTable 14-2.

Soldiers in BCT continue to develop foundational fitness and movement skills they started in the\\nFSP. Soldiers in BCT, OSUT (red, white, and blue phases), and basic officer leader course-accessions follow\\nphysical readiness training schedules that include the following drills and activities:\\n\\uf06c Preparation Drill.\\n\\uf06c Four for the Core.\\n\\uf06c Hip Stability Drill.\\n\\uf06c Shoulder Stability Drill.\\n\\uf06c Conditioning Drill 1 and Conditioning Drill 2.\\n\\uf06c Climbing Drill 1.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 14-7Chapter 14\\n\\uf06c Strength Training Circuit.\\n\\uf06c Free Weight Training.\\n\\uf06c Military Movement Drill 1.\\n\\uf06c Running Drills 1 through 6.\\n\\uf06c Interval Aerobic Run.\\n\\uf06c 30:60s.\\n\\uf06c 300 Meter Shuttle Run.\\n\\uf06c Ability Group Run.\\n\\uf06c Release Run.\\n\\uf06c Foot March with fighting load.\\n\\uf06c Recovery Drill.\\n\\uf06c PMCS.\\n14-25. The first few weeks of BCT focus on muscular endurance as movement skills are built, adding\\nhypertrophy in the later weeks. Key drills to achieve this are the Strength Training Circuit and 300 Meter\\nShuttle Run. Soldiers modify these drills by increasing the weight in the Strength Training Circuit and\\nrunning time during the 300-Meter Shuttle Run, for example. Soldiers modify the Strength Training Circuit\\nto focus on different components of strength:\\n\\uf06c For hypertrophy, do 8\u201312 repetitions, 60 second rest.\\n\\uf06c For muscular strength, do 5\u20138 repetitions, 60\u2013120 seconds rest.\\n\\uf06c For power, do 1\u20135 repetitions, 120 seconds.\\n14-26. Elastic resistance bands and kettlebells are required equipment and must be available at the platoon\\nlevel to optimize training time.\\n14-27. Missed sessions due to weather and other operational requirements are common. They should not\\nbe made up. Leaders should move to the next scheduled session after the missed one.\\n14-28. Practice for the ACFT is permitted. The practice sessions should not focus on the Soldier\u2019s score.\\nThey should focus on Soldiers completing the event to standard, understanding the standard, and correcting\\nimproper performance of the standard. Once Soldiers know the standards and understand how the test is\\nadministered, they should use physical training to improve ACFT event performance and scores. Repeated\\nDeadlifting, Standing Power Throws, and Hand-Release Push-Up practice sessions are not recommended.\\nSuch repeated sessions can over train the muscular endurance component of fitness at the expense of the\\nother components and lead to ACFT failures.\\n14-29. Skeletal tissue adaptations often happen after eight weeks of BCT. Until then, initial improvements\\nin strength and endurance will happen largely due to neurological adaptation\u2014nerves get better at sending\\nsignals to the muscles. Bones, tendons, and ligaments will continue to adapt (remodel) during this period.\\nThese structures do not receive blood at the rate that muscles do, so the risk of injury is greater if Soldiers\\noverreach in training. Muscles will begin to get bigger around Week 8\u2014muscle fiber size increases. All\\nSoldiers will have passed the OPAT before BCT. However, if they had curtailed FSPs or were deconditioned\\nprior to IMT, it may take longer for their skeletal systems to adapt.\\n14-30. Record testing of the ACFT should occur after a short taper or de-load period and on a day prior to\\nmore intense training periods such as field training exercises. When Soldiers complete their ACFT events,\\nthe grader records the number of completed repetitions, distances, or times on the DA Form 705 (Army\\nCombat Fitness Test Scorecard). If this is not the last week of the 10-week cycle, leaders should expect\\nhigher risk of lower performance.\\n14-31. Large companies and battalions with high Soldier to cadre ratios should adhere to collective\\nschedules in the initial phase. Scores from performance on drills and exercises influence the commander\u2019s\\nchoice between an endurance- or strength-focused schedule (see table 14-3, table 14-4, table 14-5 on page\\n14-10, and table 14-6 on page 14-10). More often commanders have a higher need for strength-focused\\nscheduling. Unit MFTs or other installation H2F performance team members can assist with programming\\nchoices for units without organic H2F performance teams. Both types of schedules can be found in this\\ndoctrine. Endurance- and strength-focused schedules will prepare Soldiers for ACFT and HPDTs.

Modify the time per station to target other\\ncomponents of physical readiness.\\n\\uf06c Progress the Landmine Drill 1 (a Free Weight Training Drill) based upon physical training goals\\nof the unit.\\n\\uf06c Use Running Drills 1\u20137 on recovery days to promote optimal running activity\u2014Release Runs,\\nTerrain Runs, and Hill Repeats.\\n\\uf06c Attach Suspension Training Drill 1 equipment to Climbing Pods or bars to improve a Soldier\u2019s\\nbalance, core, and upper body strength.\\n\\uf06c Use Medicine Ball Drill 1 to improve coordination, dynamic balance, and upper body endurance.\\n\\uf06c Schedule trained AIT units to regularly complete 40 or more exercises during one 60-minute\\nsession. An example would include Preparation Drill, Shoulder Stability Drill, Conditioning Drills\\n1-3, Climbing Drills 1 and 2, Sprint-Drag-Carry, and Recovery Drill.\\n\\uf06c Understand AIT running activity times are faster than BCT. Ability Groups are A, B, and C. There\\nis no D Group.\\n\\uf06c Schedule speed running at least once per week. Repetitions increase from 5 to 10 for 30:60s,\\n60:120s, and Hill Repeats and up to three repetitions for the 300-Meter Shuttle Run.\\n\\uf06c Monitor the sustained running goal of all Soldiers to pass the ACFT and the HPDTs of their MOSs.\\nIf the MOS program of instruction requires sustained run distance goals beyond 2 miles, the speed\\n(in minutes per mile) of those runs should not be faster than the goal pace for the ACFT.\\n\\uf06c Determine Foot March training based on the length of the AIT cycle, MOS requirements, and the\\nprogram of instruction. Army physical fitness uniform (known as APFU) and ACU modifications\\nassist with the exercise progression. See ATP 3-21.18 for information on foot marches.\\n14-36. Leaders conduct the ACFT in accordance to AR 40-501, using information in ATP 7-22.01, and the\\ncourse program of instruction. During AIT, leaders schedule the ACFT in week 14 (see table 14-9). During\\nOSUT, leaders schedule the ACFT in week 22 (see table 14-10 beginning on page 14-27). In both cases,\\nleaders may move the ACFT earlier in the cycle especially if a cumulative FTX is proposed for the\\npenultimate week of training. A practice ACFT scheduled at the beginning of the two-week peak period\\nprecedes the record test. For longer or shorter AIT courses, leaders can adjust the pattern of train-peak-test\\naround other program of instruction requirements.\\n14-37. Preparation for the ACFT is built into the schedules for IMT. Frequent, repeated practice of the\\nACFT or its separate events is not likely to improve pass rates or readiness. This schedule has event-specific\\npractice once per week in the weeks leading up to the record ACFT. Soldiers must train into physical\\nreadiness. They cannot test into physical readiness. The ACFT validates the physical training program. It is\\nnot the physical training program.\\n14-38. Practice and record ACFTs should be scheduled on Mondays so that Soldiers are properly recovered\\nprior to the test. A practice ACFT is an exact rehearsal of the record test event. If the record ACFT is not\\nconducted on a Monday, then no physical training will be scheduled on the day before the ACFT.\\n14-39. If the ACFT passing standard for 2-Mile Run event is 21 minutes (10:30 minutes per mile), then the\\nstandard for passing a 3 mile run cannot be faster than 31:30 minutes (10:30 minutes per mile).\\n14-40.

The FUA is a critical point for Soldiers as they transition from Army trainees to full-fledged Soldiers.\\nTherefore, it is important for leaders at the gaining unit to conduct proper assessments of a Soldier\u2019s physical\\nand nonphysical conditioning as he or she is integrated into the formation. H2F performance teams are\\nuniquely staffed and equipped to perform this function.\\n14-43. Using results from an assessment of the new Soldier, H2F performance experts in the gaining unit\\ndevelop a program that focuses on that new Soldier\u2019s needs. Table 14-11 provides a sample schedule to\\naddress a new Soldier\u2019s endurance physical limitations. Table 14-12 on page 14-39 provides a sample\\nschedule to address a new Soldier\u2019s physical limitations for power. Table 14-13 on page 14-41 provides a\\nsample schedule using hybrid approaches to address a new Soldier\u2019s physical limitations. Summarized, the\\nthree schedules look like this:\\n\\uf06c Endurance-biased schedule: 6 days per week; 3/2 endurance/strength plus one day active recovery.\\n\\uf06c Lower Body Power schedule: 2/3 endurance/strength plus one day active recovery.\\n\\uf06c Hybrid schedule: 2/2 endurance/strength with one day option and one day active recovery.\\nENDURANCE-BIASED SCHEDULE\\n14-44.

In the sustaining phase, Soldiers prepare for conditions specific to their occupational tasks.\\nOccupational tasks that require heavier loads, both physical and psychological, require heavier training loads.\\nHowever, the principles and physiological considerations outlined in Part Two remain the same for every\\nSoldier, no matter his or her occupational tasks. Training programs in the sustaining phase are designed to\\nguide every Soldier and the H2F performance team that coaches and customizes the individual Soldier\u2019s plan.\\nBUILD 1\\n14-48. The build 1 period is the first period in the sustaining phase. However, it is not the first period in the\\nSoldier\u2019s training progression. That base period was completed during the initial phase as the Soldier\\nprogressed from the FSP to the FUA. In the build periods, the basic abilities established in the initial phase\\nare further refined.\\n14-49. The build 1 period lasts four to eight weeks. Leaders use this time to build on the Soldiers\u2019 abilities\\nfrom the base period with higher intensity and increased volume of training. Training effort begins to mimic\\nthe primary goal or mission, and the period ends with a simulation of the mission or a test\u2014perhaps an FTX\\nor a practice ACFT.

The peak period covers the two to three weeks immediately prior to an event such as a deployment\\nor high physical demand mission (see table 14-16). Soldiers cannot sustain training efforts in this period\\nbeyond three weeks without leading to overtraining. Typically, a period of tapering off from the volume of\\ntraining for one to two weeks is included at the end of the peak period. The week of taper in this schedule\\nreduces training volume by 50 percent. Tapering for a short period allows accumulated fatigue to dissipate\\nwithout risking physical fitness.\\n14-52. For those Soldiers who have periodized their training over the previous months and who wish to\\nperform well on the ACFT, they would follow the peak 1 schedule with 1\u20132 days of rest before taking a\\nrecord ACFT. Depending upon the previous level of training, a typical week for a Soldier peaking for a\\ndeployment or another high physical demand assignment might include the following:\\n\\uf06c 5 days of training per week.\\n\\uf06c 1 session per day of 60-90 minutes.\\n\\uf06c 1 long event-specific session per week of several hours replicating event load, terrain, climate,\\nequipment or uniform, nutrition or hydration, and tasks.\\n\\uf06c Alternating hybrid days.\\n\\uf06c Recovery sessions that include PMCS.\\n\\uf06c AWST skill.\\n\\uf06c 3 free weight sessions per week.\\n\\uf06c A high RPE range with some maximum effort (RPE 9-10).\\nTable 14-16.

Training while deployed follows the principle that the Soldier is in the environment for which he or\\nshe has already trained. Training while deployed is important to sustain fitness, morale, and unit cohesion,\\nbut should not hinder the mission or degrade unit readiness. In high-operational tempo environments,\\ndegradation in sleep, nutrition, and training practices have caused too many Soldiers to get injured or\\nevacuated from theater.\\n14-55. Condensed training time and the use of limited equipment or tactical substitutions is appropriate in\\naustere environments. In more robust life support areas, some Soldiers may continue or increase the amount\\nof physical training in their H2F programs. Equipment, personnel, and facilities may be close to equivalent\\nto those in garrison in some cases. Planning for deployment should not assume that.\\n14-56. Fitness testing while deployed is not required nor recommended. Testing for schools that are\\nscheduled close to a Soldier\u2019s re-deployment should occur once the Soldier has had time to recover after\\ndeployment. Schools that require a record ACFT to attend or graduate will accept the most-recent record\\nACFT prior to the deployment.\\nTRANSITION\\n14-57. After reaching a peak level of fitness, completing an event, functional school or deployment,\\nSoldiers will need to reset and rebuild their readiness. This starts with a transition period of several weeks to\\nmonths and ends when a new Build period begins (see table 14-18). The main feature of this period might\\ninclude self-paced rallying from being deconditioned, injured or ill; a return to practicing fundamental\\nmovement skills; a reduction in high intensity and high volume training; and special emphasis on nutritional\\n14-52 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Holistic Health and Fitness Schedules\\nreadiness, mental readiness, spiritual readiness, and sleep readiness.

An ideal unit H2F program strives to give Soldiers the knowledge they need to conduct their own\\nquality training sessions between unit assemblies. The training program should increase Soldier motivation\\nso they habitually train on their own. Incorporating this training into inactive duty training periods is one way\\nto affect motivation with the added benefit of providing commanders a readiness snapshot. For example,\\nteaching drills during unit assemblies so that Soldiers can then practice on their own raises collective\\nproficiency and readiness (see table 14-20). Soldiers are then prepared for subsequent inactive duty training\\nand annual training. Features of this training schedule include the following:\\n\\uf06c 5 sessions over a week.\\n\\uf06c 60 minute sessions.\\n\\uf06c One mid-week recovery session.\\n\\uf06c One condensed-time session per week.\\n\\uf06c One commercial gym session example using ETMs and STMs.\\n14-60.
