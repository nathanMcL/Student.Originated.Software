Sun Tzu divided them into two com-\\npanies, and placed one of the King\u2019s favorite concubines at the head of\\neach. He then bade them all take spears in their hands, and addressed\\nthem thus: \"I presume you know the difference between front and back,\\nrighthandandlefthand?\"\\nThegirlsreplied: Yes.\\nSunTzuwenton:\"WhenIsay\"Eyesfront,\"youmustlookstraightahead.\\nWhenIsay\"Leftturn,\"youmustfacetowardsyourlefthand.

Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) card 308\\n10TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nIntroduction\\nThe \u201cBlue Book\u201d\\nSince 1775, U.S. Army\\nSoldiers exhibited\\nunwavering courage, self- discipline, military expertise, and\\nesprit de corps, through tough, challenging military training\\nand combat operations. Soldiers, like you, volunteered to\\nserve and fight to protect their families and friends from\\nenemies that sought to do us harm, and to defend the ideals\\nof our nation.\\nWe gain strength from training, and the basis for our training\\nstems from a past deeply rooted in determination and\\nadaptability.\\nFrom the beginning,\\nAmerican Soldiers were\\nbrave and fought with\\ndetermination but were at a\\nmilitary disadvantage when\\nfighting against highly\\ntrained and better organized British and Hessian Soldiers.\\nTo win the Revolutionary War, General George\\nWashington\u2019s Army needed training, discipline, and esprit\\nde corps.\\nSeeking a solution, General Washington tasked Baron von\\nSteuben with transforming the large group of hungry and\\nexhausted men at Valley Forge into a disciplined fighting\\nforce. In the harsh Pennsylvania winter, Baron von Steuben\\ninstructed a company of future leaders in basic military\\n11TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nmovements and tactical skills; those individuals were the\\npredecessors of our Drill Sergeants!\\nHe developed those cadre members until they could, in turn,\\ntrain the entire Revolutionary Army in the art of basic military\\nmaneuvers. Through their perseverance and sense of duty,\\nthese dedicated troops achieved the highest standards. As\\na result, Washington\u2019s men fought skillfully and\\ndemonstrated the discipline of a professional Army.\\nUltimately, the Army won the Revolutionary war and\\nindependence after 8 years of fighting.\\nTraining to standard and developing the commitment to\\nadapt and overcome adversity became the hallmarks of the\\nAmerican Soldier. Baron von Steuben, by then the Army\\nInspector General, wrote the Regulations for the Order and\\nDiscipline of the Troops of the United States\u2014now\\ncommonly referred to as the Soldier\u2019s Blue Book\u2014an\\ninstructional guide for future generations. This book consists\\nof detailed training procedures, the standards of military\\nconduct, and the fundamentals every Soldier needs to\\nknow.\\nUse this Soldier\u2019s Blue Book on the journey you are about to\\nundertake. Just as the Soldiers before you trained to serve\\nand protect our Nation, this book will help you to learn, train\\nand perform the tasks required of you to become Soldiers in\\nthe U.S. Army.\\n12TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nChapter 1 \u2013 The Army\\nOn 14 June 1775, the Second Continental Congress\\nestablished \u201cthe American Continental Army.\u201d The U.S.\\nArmy is the senior Service of the Armed Forces. As one of\\nthe oldest American institutions, it predates the Declaration\\nof Independence and the Constitution. For almost two and a\\nhalf centuries, Army forces have protected this Nation. Our\\nArmy flag is adorned with over 190 campaign and battle\\nstreamers to date, each one signifying great sacrifice on\\nbehalf of the Nation.\\nThe Army\u2019s mission is to fight and win the Nation\u2019s wars\\nthrough prompt and sustained land combat, as part of the\\njoint force.\\n13TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n1-1. Why we have an Army\\nIt is the intent of Congress to provide an Army that is\\ncapable, in conjunction with the other armed forces,\\nof-\\nPreserving the peace and security, and\\nproviding for the defense of the United States,\\nthe Commonwealths and possessions, and any\\nareas occupied by the United States;\\nSupporting the national policies; Implementing\\nthe national objectives; and\\nOvercoming any nations responsible for\\naggressive acts that imperil the peace and\\nsecurity of the United States.\\nTitle 10, U.S. Code, Section 7062(a)\\n14TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nFigure 1-1. Army timeline\\n15TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nFigure 1-2. Army timeline - 1775 to present\\n16TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n1-2. What the Army uniform represents\\nArmy uniforms include those designed for formal occasions,\\nduty within an office or in garrison, and for tactical training\\nand operations. Wearing the uniform of a U.S. Army Soldier\\nis an honor and a privilege which must be earned. When we\\ntake our Oath of Service and are authorized to wear the\\nuniform, we incur a sacred obligation to live by and uphold\\nthe moral principles of the Army Ethic and perform our duty\\nprofessionally.\\nFor Army Families, the uniform is a source of both pride and\\nsacrifice.\\nLiving by and upholding the Army Ethic is our life-long\\ncommitment. For our veterans, it represents one of the most\\nimportant periods of their lives: pride in honorable service,\\naccomplishments as part of a team, and a life-long\\nconnection to the comrades with whom they served, and in\\nsome cases, lost during their time in uniform.\\nWhen Soldiers return to society as private citizens, they are\\nexpected to continue to be moral-ethical role models for\\ntheir Families and communities, contributing to the well-\\nbeing of the United States of America, as Soldiers for Life.\\nFor the American people, Soldiers are their sons, daughters,\\nrelatives, and neighbors. In us they see patriotism,\\nhonorable service, and courage.\\nBeing seen as defenders of our freedoms you are expected\\nto earn and sustain the trust of our society.\\nPeople around the world recognize the American Soldier as\\na symbol of the United States and its values, democracy,\\n17TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nand a commitment to defend the right of all people to life,\\nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\\nTo our enemies, the Soldier represents American strength,\\nresolve, and a commitment to defend the values that we\\nhold dear as a Nation.\\n1-3. Why we serve\\nAs Soldiers, we are committed to do our duty to contribute\\nto the \u201ccommon defense;\u201d we share a love of our country\\nand of our Army Family; we defend American values that\\nframe the nation as expressed in the Declaration of\\nIndependence and the Constitution of the United States;\\nand we serve \u201cnot to promote war, but to preserve peace.\u201d\\n1-4. The Army\u2019s Motto \u2013 \u201cThis We\u2019ll Defend\u201d\\nThe Army\u2019s motto remains as relevant today as it did at our\\nNation\u2019s founding. The pronoun \u201cWe\u201d reinforces our\\ncollective team effort and \u201cDefend\u201d remains our Army\u2019s main\\nmission. The Army continues this pledge into the future, as\\nwe have done since 1775.\\nDepartment of the Army Emblem\\n18TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n1-5. Oath of Enlistment\\nMembers of the American Armed Services swear or affirm\\nto support and defend the Constitution of the United\\nStates\u2014not a leader, people, government, or territory.\\nThat solemn oath ties service in the Army directly to the\\nfounding document of the United States. The oath\\nexpresses a noble calling to honorable service on behalf of\\nthe American people.\\nWe serve because we believe America must be defended\\nby a Professional Army of Soldiers and Army Civilians who\\nare inspired to honorably fulfill their Oaths of Service. We\\naccomplish our missions as a team, partnering with the\\nother armed forces in the joint community and with\\ngovernment services that dedicate themselves to defending\\nthe U.S. Constitution and protect the Nation\u2019s interests, at\\nhome and abroad, against all threats.\u201d\\nFigure 1-3. Army Oath of Enlistment\\n19TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nChapter 2 \u2013 The Army as a Profession\\n2-1. The Army Profession\\nOur shared identity, as trusted Army professionals, derives\\nfrom our shared understanding of and respect for those\\nwhose legacy we celebrate. We honor this cherished\\ninheritance in our customs, courtesies, and traditions. Units\\nand organizations preserve their storied histories and\\nproudly display distinctive emblems (regimental colors,\\ncrests, insignia, patches, and mottos). The campaign\\nstreamers on the Army flag remind us of our history of\\nhonorable service to the Nation. These symbols recall the\\nsacrifices and preserve the ties with those who preceded us.\\nFigure 2-1. Army Profession\\nThe essential Characteristics of the Army profession are:\\nTrust, Military Expertise, Honorable Service, Stewardship\\n20TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nand Esprit de Corps.\\nOur Army Profession includes two mutually supporting\\ncommunities of practice\u2014\\n\u2022 The Profession of Arms: Soldiers of the Regular\\nArmy, Army National Guard, and U.S. Army Reserve.\\n\u2022 The Army Civilian Corps composed of civilian\\nprofessionals serving in the Department of the Army.\\nThe Army Ethic: The heart of the Army and the inspiration\\nfor our shared professional identity \u2013 Who we are and why\\nand how we serve. It motivates and guides our conduct as\\nSoldiers and Army Civilians who are bound together with the\\nArmy Culture of trust in common moral purpose.\\n2-2. What it means to be a Soldier\\nSoldiers are trusted professionals of character, competence,\\nand commitment. The Army is an honored profession,\\nfounded on the bedrock of trust \u2013 trust among leaders,\\npeers, and subordinates; between Soldiers and Army\\nCivilians; trust in the Army professionals, and their families;\\nand trust between the Army and the American people. By\\nour solemn oath, we are morally committed to support and\\ndefend the Constitution. This duty requires a foundation of\\ntrust with the American people who grant us autonomy to\\nuse lethal force on their behalf, only because we have\\nearned their trust. Army professionals understand and\\naccept that they may give their lives and justly take the lives\\nof others to accomplish the mission. The moral implications\\nof this realization compel essential bonds of mutual trust\\nwithin cohesive teams. The Nation tasks the Army to do\\nmany things besides combat operations, but ultimately, the\\n21TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nmission of the U.S. Army is to fight and win our Nation\u2019s\\nwars through prompt and sustained land combat as part of\\nthe joint force. The Army and each of its members must\\nmaintain the readiness to accomplish this mission, now and\\nin the future. Once a Soldier, always a Soldier\u2026A Soldier\\nfor Life.\\n2-3. Who we are not\\nArmy Professionals do not engage in or tolerate acts of\\nmisconduct or unethical decisions. Soldiers do not lie,\\ncheat, steal, or treat others and their property with\\ndisrespect. Actions such as sexual harassment, sexual\\nassault, and hazing are dishonorable and violate the Army\\nValues and the Army Ethic while destroying trust, unit\\ncohesion, and esprit de corps. One incident is one too\\nmany.\\nSexual harassment is a form of discrimination that involves\\nunwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors,\\nand deliberate or repeated offensive comments or gestures\\nof a sexual nature.\\nSexual assault is intentional sexual contact, characterized\\nby use of force, threats, intimidation, or abuse of authority or\\nwhen the victim does not or cannot consent. The term\\nincludes a broad range of sexual offenses including the\\nfollowing specific Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)\\noffenses: rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual contact,\\nabusive sexual contact, forcible sodomy (forced oral or anal\\nsex), and attempts to commit these acts.\\nHazing is defined as any conduct whereby one military\\nmember or employee, regardless of Service or rank,\\n22TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nunnecessarily causes another military member or employee,\\nregardless of Service or rank, to suffer or be exposed to an\\nactivity that is cruel, abusive, or harmful.\\nBullying is the use of force, threat, or coercion to abuse\\nintimidate, or aggressively dominate others. The behavior is\\noften repeated and habitual.\\n2-4. The Army\u2019s commitment to you\\nOur commitment to you is to help guide you on this journey\\nfrom an aspiring member of the Army Profession to a\\nSoldier who is certified in character, competence, and\\ncommitment.\\nWe are committed to providing you with a safe and secure\\nenvironment where everyone can live, train, and learn, while\\ndeveloping into Soldiers of\u2026\\n\u2022 Character: Soldiers who understand, adhere to, and\\nuphold the Army Ethic, as demonstrated by their\\ndecisions and actions.\\n\u2022 Competence: Soldiers who demonstrate the ability\\nto perform their duty with discipline and to standard.\\n\u2022 Commitment: Soldiers who demonstrate the resolve\\nto contribute honorable service to the Nation and\\naccomplish the mission despite adversity, obstacles,\\nand challenges.\\nIn turn, you join the ranks of generations of Soldiers who\\npreviously answered the call to defend America\u2019s freedoms;\\nyou join a band of brothers and sisters who are prepared to\\nserve this Nation in peace and in war; and you join the Army\\nProfession, a profession dedicated to upholding the values\\n23TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nand ideals of our Country and its people that we serve and\\nrepresent.\\nOur desired outcome as you complete your initial\\ncertification process is to provide the Army with a Soldier:\\n\u2022 Competent in basic combat skills and unique\\nspecialties.\\n\u2022 Who is a disciplined individual of character.\\n\u2022 Who is physically fit and ready to execute required\\nSoldier and occupational specialty skills.\\n\u2022 Acculturated with Army Values, the Soldier\u2019s Creed,\\nand Army history.\\n\u2022 Who is a trusted member of the Army team.\\n\u2022 Committed to serving the Army and Nation.\\n\u2022 Who is mentally capable and committed to serve as\\na trusted member of a team in their first unit of\\nassignment.\\n2-5. The journey begins\\nWhen you took the Oath of Enlistment, you became a\\nmember of the Army Profession, albeit an aspiring\\nprofessional.\\nThe task at hand is to develop and certify you in Character,\\nCompetence, and Commitment. The responsibility for\\neveryone\u2019s development and certification is a mutual one, a\\ntrusted bond, shared between you, your leaders, and the\\nArmy.\\n24TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nThe first certification in becoming an Army Professional\\nincludes demonstrating the knowledge and skills to serve as\\na trusted Soldier in your first unit of assignment.\\n2-6. Army Values\\nOur ethical and moral foundation as Soldiers is solidified in\\nthe seven Army Values: Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless\\nService, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage.\\nThey are at the core of who we are as individuals, as\\nSoldiers, as Professionals and as Americans. Whether on or\\noff-duty, Soldiers live these values every day.\\nThe easiest way to remember the Army Values is through\\nthe acronym \u201cLDRSHIP\u201d.\\nFigure 2-2. Army Values\\n25TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nLOYALTY: Bear true faith and allegiance to the U.S.\\nConstitution, the Army, your unit, and other Soldiers.\\nBearing true faith and allegiance is a matter of believing in\\nand devoting yourself to something or someone. A loyal\\nSoldier is one who supports the leadership and stands up\\nfor fellow Soldiers. By wearing the uniform of the U.S. Army,\\nyou express your loyalty. Doing your share displays loyalty\\nto your unit.\\nDUTY: Fulfill your obligations.\\nPerforming your duty means more than carrying out your\\nassigned tasks. Duty means the ability to accomplish tasks\\nas part of a team. The work of the U.S. Army is a complex\\ncombination of missions, tasks, and responsibilities \u2014 all in\\nconstant motion. Our work entails building one assignment\\nonto another. You fulfill your obligations as a part of your\\nunit every time you resist the temptation to take \u201cshortcuts\u201d\\nthat might undermine the integrity of the final product.\\nRESPECT: Treat people as they should be treated.\\nIn the Soldier\u2019s Code, we pledge to \u201ctreat others with dignity\\nand respect while expecting others to do the same.\u201d\\nRespect is what allows us to appreciate the best in other\\npeople. Respect is trusting that all people performed their\\njobs and fulfilled their duty. Self-respect is a vital ingredient\\nwith the Army value of respect, which results from knowing\\nyou put your best effort forward. The Army is one team and\\neach of us contributes something.\\nSELFLESS SERVICE: Put the welfare of the Nation, the\\nArmy, and your subordinates before your own.\\n26TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nSelfless service is larger than just one person. In serving\\nyour country, you are doing your duty loyally without thought\\nof recognition or gain. The basic building block of selfless\\nservice is the commitment of each team member to go a\\nlittle further, endure a little longer, and look a little closer to\\nsee how he or she can add to the effort.\\nHONOR: Live up to all the Army Values.\\nThe nation\u2019s highest military award is The Medal of Honor.\\nThis award goes to Soldiers who make honor a matter of\\ndaily living \u2014 Soldiers who develop the habit of being\\nhonorable and solidify that habit with every value choice\\nthey make. Honor is a matter of carrying out, acting, and\\nliving the values of respect, duty, loyalty, selfless service,\\nintegrity, and personal courage in everything you do.\\nINTEGRITY: Do what\u2019s right, legally and morally.\\nIntegrity is a quality you develop by adhering to moral\\nprinciples. It requires that you do and say nothing that\\ndeceives others. As your integrity grows, so does the trust\\nothers place in you. The more choices you make based on\\nintegrity, the more this highly prized value will affect your\\nrelationships with family and friends, and, finally, the\\nfundamental acceptance of yourself.\\nPERSONAL COURAGE: Face fear, danger, or adversity\\n(physical or moral).\\nPersonal courage has long been associated with our Army.\\nWith physical courage, it is a matter of enduring physical\\nduress and at times risking personal safety. Facing moral\\nfear or adversity may be a long, slow process of continuing\\nforward on the right path, especially if taking those actions is\\n27TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nnot popular with others. You can build your personal\\ncourage daily by standing up for and acting upon the things\\nthat you know are honorable.\\nNote: Information identified by a \u201cstar\u201d requires\\nmemorization.\\n2-7.

Soldier\u2019s Creed\\n28TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n2-8. Expectations for Army Soldiers and Leaders\\na. American Soldiers live the Golden Rule, Army\\nValues, the Soldier\u2019s Creed, and the Warrior Ethos. Soldiers\\ndo their best, enforce standards, and get the job done.\\nSoldiers persevere despite privation, chaos, and\\nuncertainty; refusing to quit or lose.\\nb. American Soldiers are Skilled. Able to perform their\\ntasks in the dark, in the rain, under fire, and without thinking\\nabout it. The rest of the Army can count on them to do their\\njob.\\nc. American Soldiers are Tough. Army Tough\u2026\\nResilient\u2026mentally and physically. Tough and resilient\\nenough to be comfortable being uncomfortable, to take a\\nsurprise or shock and bounce right back into the fight, to\\nmove as far and fast as necessary, and to fight as long and\\nas hard as necessary to win.\\nd. American Soldiers are Ready to deploy, move, or\\nfight. They are mentally prepared for anything.\\ne. American Soldiers are Alert. They \u201clive on Amber.\u201d\\nThey pay attention to what is going on around them, see\\nwhat is coming towards them, and notice when something is\\nout of place. A curious scout is looking behind doors and\\nunderneath tarps on patrol. They have an edge in combat\\nbecause they see bad things before they happen.\\nf. American Soldiers are confident. Confident in\\nthemselves, at their job, with their weapon, in their\\nteammates and their unit.\\n29TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\ng. American Soldiers act with disciplined initiative.\\nSoldiers do the right thing even when no one is looking.\\nSoldiers do not sit and wait for orders. They determine what\\nneeds to be done and do it without being told. Soldiers\\nfollow SOPs and orders but are smart enough to see when\\nthe plan is failing; no longer fits the situation or the enemy is\\npresenting an opportunity; smart enough to come up with a\\nnew plan that will work and have the guts enough to do it.\\nh. Army Leaders lead by personal example. They share\\nrisks and hardships with their Soldiers. They lead by the\\nconcepts of mission command, mission orders and\\ncommander\u2019s intent to empower the disciplined initiative of\\ntheir troops. They carefully plan, in advance, but stay\\nflexible in execution. They are not afraid to take measured\\nrisks or to act decisively when the situation is uncertain.\\ni. Army Leaders are responsible and accountable for\\ntheir decisions, their troops, and their equipment.\\nj. Army Leaders know that, foremost, they must train\\ntheir Soldiers to fight, win, and come home alive. They\\nknow, \u201cthe more we sweat in peace, the less we bleed in\\nwar.\u201d They know we must practice being operationally\\neffective in miserable conditions and we will fight like we\\ntrain.\\nk. Army Leaders ensure their unit is secure, postured,\\nand ready to move or fight on short notice. They check\\nsecurity before bedding down. They are never surprised by\\nthe enemy because they take precautions to prevent\\nsurprise.\\n30TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nChapter 3 \u2013 The Reception Battalion\\n3-1. The Path\\nWelcome to the reception battalion. Being here means that\\nyou met your initial entry qualification requirements. While at\\nthe military entrance processing station (MEPS) you\\nunderwent a battery of aptitude tests and medical\\nexaminations to determine if you were qualified for military\\nservice. Congratulations, you passed!\\nYou were vetted mentally, physically, and intellectually, by\\npassing the Occupational Physical Assessment Test\\n(OPAT), and the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude\\nBattery (ASVAB). You know your future military\\noccupational specialty (MOS) \u2013 what your job entails, and\\nqualified for that job by taking and passing the OPAT and\\nwere sworn into the U.S. Army. Now it\u2019s time for you to\\nbegin the transformation to becoming a Soldier.\\nYou are at one of the following BCT/OSUT locations:\\n\u2022 Fort Moore, Georgia\\n\u2022 Fort Jackson, South Carolina\\n\u2022 Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri\\n\u2022 Fort Sill, Oklahoma\\nIf your MOS is 11B/11C (Infantryman), 19D (Cavalry Scout),\\n19K (Armor Crewman), 12B (Combat Engineer) or 31B\\n(Military Police Officer), you will conduct your BCT and\\noccupational skills training in one course. This is called \u201cOne\\nStation Unit Training\u201d or \u201cOSUT\u201d. OSUT is conducted at Fort\\n31TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nMoore for 11B and 19K Soldiers, and at Fort Leonard Wood\\nfor 12B and 31B Soldiers.\\nAll other Soldiers will go through BCT at one of the four\\nlocations listed above, and upon completion, will attend a\\nfollow-on course called \u201cAdvanced Individual Training\u201d or\\n\u201cAIT.\u201d This course may be at the same installation as your\\nBCT training or may be at another location.\\nAt the successful completion of OSUT or AIT, you will be\\nawarded your MOS and receive a basic understanding of\\ncharacter, competence, and commitment as a trusted Army\\nprofessional and Soldier for Life.\\nWhile at the reception battalion, you will undergo further\\nmedical and dental processing. Medical and dental\\nprocessing includes collection of blood for certain\\nimmunities, type, and deoxyribonucleic acid (known as\\nDNA); hearing and vision exams (in addition to the MEPS\\nexams); pregnancy screening; tuberculosis screening;\\nimmunizations; and a brief dental exam and x-rays. You will\\nreceive ear plugs, mouth guard, eyewear, eye protection,\\nand personal protective items such as sunscreen. These are\\nall items of \u201cindividual medical readiness\u201d that you will\\nmaintain throughout your career.\\nYou will also undergo further administrative processing\\n(personnel and finance records, and security clearance if\\napplicable).\\nYou will receive a standard military haircut, be issued your\\ninitial clothing requirement, to include physical fitness and\\nArmy combat uniforms (ACUs), footwear and miscellaneous\\nclothing items. You will be taught how to properly wear the\\n32TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nclothing issued and begin to learn the basics of military\\nculture.\\nYour actions and ability to follow instructions will be\\nmonitored carefully. A drill sergeant or cadre member will\\ntake you through the stations required for you to enter the\\nArmy.\\nFollow all instructions and pay attention to detail. One of the\\nkey elements to being successful in the Army is to\\nunderstand what is required of you and to ask questions if\\nyou are unsure.\\nA typical stay in the reception battalion lasts 3-5 days for\\nBCT Soldiers and 5-7 days for OSUT Soldiers.\\nAfter completing reception in-processing, you will be\\nassigned to a training company. Drill sergeants will pick you\\nup at the reception battalion and travel with you to your BCT\\nor OSUT company location.\\nEagleCash Value Card: While at the reception battalion,\\nyou will be issued an EagleCash Value Card, which has a\\nvalue of $350.00 for males and $756.60 for females, as your\\ninitial advance of pay. This includes the $406.60 cash\\nallowance for females as part of their initial clothing\\nallowance. The stored value card reduces cash/check\\noperations. The card can be used at the Army and Air Force\\nExchange Service (AAFES) sites\\n(barber shops, clothing sales, and\\nPost Exchange facilities).\\nAny remaining value at expiration is\\nreturned to the Soldier; however, you\\nwill likely spend the full amount prior to completion of your\\n33TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\ntraining. If you deploy immediately with your first unit of\\nassignment, you may retain the card for up to 5 years.\\n3-2. Critical information needed upfront\\nDuring your stay at the reception battalion, BCT or OSUT,\\nyou are expected to read, study, and memorize necessary\\ninformation. The purpose of the information is to introduce\\nand reinforce who we are as Army Professionals and what\\nwe represent as Soldiers. Your job is to fully understand,\\ncomprehend and demonstrate your proficiency by reciting it\\nto the drill sergeant and leaders either individually or as a\\ngroup.\\n3-3. The Battle Buddy System\\nSoldiers rely on one another to stay motivated and reach\\npeak performance. Although required in Initial Military\\nTraining, Soldiers will form natural bonds with their fellow\\nSoldiers as part of Army culture. To contribute to this team\\nspirit, we live by the buddy system. A buddy team is usually\\ndefined as two Soldiers (same gender) in the same unit who\\nalways look after each other.\\nBy getting to know other Soldiers on a professional and\\npersonal level, you learn how to improve yourself and\\nencourage others. Working together, you and your battle\\nbuddy learn initiative, responsibility, trust, and dependability.\\nWhile at the reception battalion, BCT or OSUT, same-\\ngender Soldiers (male-male and female-female) are placed\\nin buddy teams.

To avoid confusion due to time differences, the\\nmilitary uses the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) zones,\\nwhere a phonetic alphabet is assigned to different regions\\nacross the world according to the number of hours they are\\nEast or West of the Prime Meridian. The military often refers\\nto ZULU (Z) time zone, or UTC+00:00, which is also the\\n52TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\ntime zone name for Greenwich, England. For example, 7:00\\na.m. in UTC is written as 0700Z and spoken as \u201czero seven\\nhundred Zulu\u201d.\\n4-11.

If your body fat exceeds the\\nstandards, you have six months (180 days) to meet\\nweight/body fat compliance in Army Regulation 600-9.\\n4-12. What is the difference between drill sergeants\\nand platoon sergeants (PSG)?\\nThe difference between drill sergeants and platoon\\nsergeants is the environment in which they train you. Your\\nBCT experience will be highly supervised by drill sergeants\\nas you are encouraged and evaluated on your ability to\\nreach the highest Army standards. The drill sergeant\\nenforces standards, and their focus is on \u201cattention to\\ndetail.\u201d Their job is to ensure you are mentally and\\nphysically fit to earn your place as a member of a team and\\nbe able to contribute as a soldier in AIT and first unit.\\nDuring AIT and the latter portion of OSUT, the drill sergeant\\nworks with instructors and cadre members on a training\\nenvironment that best prepares you for your first unit of\\nassignment (FUA). You will learn your job skills and\\nadditional Soldier skills in an atmosphere geared to prepare\\nyou to perform your occupational specialty in a unit.\\nIn your first unit of assignment, you will report to your\\nplatoon leader (PL) and/or platoon sergeant (PSG) and\\nsquad leaders (SQD LDR) that are assigned to your\\ncompany. The roles of the PL/PSG and SQD LDRs are\\n55TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\ncomparable even though they train Soldiers in different\\nenvironments. Drill sergeants transform new recruits into\\nSoldiers. PL/PSG and SQD LDRs reinforce the training you\\nlearned in BCT/AIT/OSUT and prepare you for your\\nassignment in the company where standard operating\\nprocedures (SOP) are followed.\\nPLs, PSGs, SQD LDRs and MOS Instructors train Soldiers\\nto become proficient at their MOS/Army job.\\nYour SQD LDR and PSG will counsel and mentor you to\\nhelp further develop your skills as a soldier and a member of\\nthe team. The PSG is normally a sergeant first class (E-7)\\nbut can be a staff sergeant (E-6) and has 3-4 squad leaders\\nthat assist him/her in your development. The PSG helps\\nwith assignment instructions, any training or family issues,\\nand provides guidance throughout your assignment.\\nAIT drill sergeants\u2019 help Soldiers transition from a\\ncompletely supervised environment to one that involves\\n56TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nmore individual responsibility. This gives you a better\\nunderstanding of the duties, discipline, and responsibilities\\nyou must maintain as a Soldier. Your adventure has just\\nstarted. Challenges await you and demand your complete\\nattention to detail. Be proud of the accomplishments you\\ncomplete and look forward to the journey ahead of you.\\nOnce a Soldier, always a Soldier.\\n4-13. General orders and special orders\\nGeneral orders:\\n1. I will guard everything within the limits of my post\\nand quit my post only when properly relieved.\\n2. I will obey my special orders and perform all my\\nduties in a military manner.\\n3. I will report violations of my special orders,\\nemergencies, and anything not covered in my\\ninstructions to the commander of relief.\\n57TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nSpecial orders: Additional requirements or instructions that\\naugment the general orders.\\n4-14.

It is\\nindicative of esprit de corps and morale within a unit.\\nSoldiers have an individual responsibility to ensure their\\nappearance reflects the highest level of professionalism.\\nYour uniform is only part of your appearance. To look like a\\nSoldier, you need to be physically fit, meet acceptable\\nweight standards, have a neat hairstyle in accordance with\\nArmy regulations, and always conduct yourself in a manner\\nreflecting your professional status treating others with\\ndignity and respect.\\nNote: While attending BCT/OSUT/AIT some of the personal\\nappearance allowances may be restricted while undergoing\\ntraining. Your drill sergeants, cadre, and instructors will\\ninform you of these restrictions.\\nSee Army Regulation (AR) 670-1 and/or DA Pamphlet 670-1\\nfor additional inquiries concerning Army uniforms and\\nawards.\\nNote: When traveling from BCT to AIT you will wear ACUs,\\nor appropriate civilian attire, directed by the commander.\\nThe Army Green Service Uniform (AGSU) may be directed\\nby the Commander when traveling to AIT, Holiday Block\\nLeave, or other authorized leave locations.\\n61TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nGrooming standards for male personnel.

While at BCT,\\nfemales are not required to receive a standard haircut.\\nThe requirements for hair regulations are to maintain\\nuniformity within a military population for female Soldiers\\nwhile in uniform, or in civilian clothes on duty, unless\\notherwise specified. Hairstyles may not be eccentric or\\nfaddish and will present a conservative, professional\\nappearance. For the purpose of these regulations, female\\nhairstyles are organized into three basic categories: short\\nlength, medium length, and long length hair. See AR 670-1\\nfor more information.\\nShort length. Short hair is defined as hair length that\\nextends no more than 1 inch (25.4 millimeter) from the scalp\\n(excluding bangs). Hair may be no shorter than 1/4 inch (.25\\nmillimeter) from the scalp (unless due to medical condition\\nor injury) but may be evenly tapered to the scalp within 2\\ninches (50.8 mm) of the hair line edges. Bangs, if worn, may\\nnot fall below the eyebrows, may not interfere with the wear\\nof all headgear, must lie neatly against the head, and not be\\nvisible underneath the front of the headgear. The width of\\nthe bangs may extend to the hairline at the temple.\\nMedium length. Medium hair is defined as hair length that\\ndoes not extend beyond the lower edge of the collar (in all\\nuniforms) and extends more than 1 inch (25.4 mm) from the\\nscalp.\\n63TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nMedium hair may fall naturally in uniform and is not required\\nto be secured. When worn loose, graduated hair styles are\\nacceptable, but the length, as measured from the end of the\\ntotal hair length to the base of the collar, may not exceed 1\\ninch (25.4 mm) difference in length, from the front to the\\nback. Layered hairstyles are also authorized, so long as\\neach hair\u2019s length, as measured from the scalp to the hair\u2019s\\nend, is generally the same length giving a tapered\\nappearance. The regulations for the wear of bangs detailed\\nabove, apply. No portion of the bulk of the hair, as\\nmeasured from the scalp, will exceed 2 inches (50.8 mm).\\nLong length. Long hair is defined as hair length that\\nextends beyond the lower edge of the collar. Long hair will\\nbe neatly and inconspicuously fastened or pinned, except\\nthat bangs may be worn. The regulations for the wear of\\nbangs detailed above, apply. No portion of the bulk of the\\nhair, as measured from the scalp, will exceed 2 inches (50.8\\nmm) (except a bun, which may extend a maximum of 3\\ninches (76.2 mm) from the scalp) and be no wider than the\\nwidth of the head. Long length hair may be worn in a\\nponytail during physical training. A single ponytail centered\\non the back of the head is authorized only when within the\\nscope of physical training, except when considered a safety\\nhazard. The ponytail is not required to be worn above the\\ncollar.\\nWhen hair securing devices are worn, they will comply with\\nthe guidelines. Hairstyles otherwise authorized in this\\nchapter (such as braids and twists) may also be worn in a\\nponytail during physical training.\\n64TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nBraids, cornrows, and twists. Medium and long hair may\\nbe styled with braids, cornrows, or twists (see glossary for\\ndefinitions). Each braid, cornrow, or twist will be of uniform\\ndimension, have a diameter no greater than 1/2 inch, (6.35\\nmm) and present a neat, professional, and well-groomed\\nappearance. Each must have the same approximate size of\\nspacing between the braids, cornrows, or twists. Each\\nhairstyle may be worn against the scalp or loose (free\\nhanging). When worn loose, such hairstyles must be worn\\nper medium hair length guidelines or secured to the head in\\nthe same manner as described for medium or long length\\nhair styles. Ends must be secured inconspicuously. When\\nmultiple loose braids or twists are worn, they must\\nencompass the whole head. When braids, twists, or\\ncornrows are not worn loosely and instead worn close to the\\nscalp, they may stop at one consistent location of the head\\nand must follow the natural direction of the hair when worn\\nback, which is either in general straight lines following the\\nshape of the head or flowing with the natural direction of the\\nhair when worn back with one primary part in the hair.\\nHairstyles may not be styled with designs, sharply curved\\nlines, or zigzag lines. Only one distinctive style (braided,\\nrolled, or twisted) may be worn at one time. Braids,\\ncornrows, or twists that distinctly protrude (up or out) from\\nthe head are not authorized.\\nDreadlocks or locks. Female Soldiers may wear\\ndreadlocks or locks in accordance with the guidance for\\nbraids, cornrows, and twists.\\n65TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nJewelry\\nA wristwatch, identification bracelet, and up to two rings (a\\nwedding set is one other ring) may be worn with your\\nuniform if they are conservative and tasteful. Soldiers may\\nalso wear one activity tracker, pedometer, or heart rate\\nmonitor. You may wear a religious medal on a chain around\\nyour neck provided neither medal nor chain can be seen.\\nEarrings may be screw-on, clip-on, or post-type earrings, in\\ngold, silver, white pearl, or diamond. The earrings will not\\nexceed 6 mm or 1\u20444 inch (6.35 mm) in diameter, and they\\nmust be unadorned and spherical. When worn, the earrings\\nwill fit snugly against the ear. Females may wear earrings\\nonly as a matched pair, with only one earring per ear lobe.\\nNote: Soldiers are not authorized to wear earrings with any\\nclass C (utility) uniform (ACU, hospital duty, food service,\\nphysical fitness, field, or organizational).\\nBody piercing\\nNo displaying objects, articles, jewelry, or ornamentation\\nattached or affixed to or through the skin may be worn while\\nin uniform. Such adornments are not allowed while wearing\\ncivilian clothes (on or off duty) when on any military\\ninstallation, or other places under military control. When not\\nin uniform and off duty, earring wear is not restricted if the\\nearrings do not create or support ear gauging (enlarged\\nholes in the lobe of the ear, greater than 1.6mm). Follow\\nArmy Regulation 670-1 guidance.\\n66TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nCosmetics\\nStandards regarding cosmetics are necessary to maintain\\nuniformity and to avoid an extreme or unprofessional\\nappearance. Males are prohibited from wearing cosmetics,\\nexcept when medically prescribed. Females are authorized\\nto wear cosmetics with all uniforms, provided they are\\napplied modestly and conservatively, and that they\\ncomplement both the Soldier\u2019s complexion and the uniform.\\nLeaders at all levels must exercise professional judgment\\nwhen interpreting and enforcing this policy. Eccentric,\\nexaggerated, or faddish cosmetic styles and colors, to\\ninclude makeup designed to cover tattoos, are inappropriate\\nwith the uniform and are prohibited.\\nPermanent makeup, such as eyebrow or eyeliner, is\\nauthorized if the makeup conforms to the standards outlined\\nabove. Eyelash extensions are not authorized unless\\nmedically prescribed.\\nFemales will not wear shades of lipstick that distinctly\\ncontrast with the natural color of their lips, that detract from\\nthe uniform, or that are faddish, eccentric, or exaggerated.\\nFemales will comply with the cosmetics policy while in any\\nmilitary uniform or while in civilian clothes on duty.\\nFingernails\\nAll personnel will keep fingernails clean and neatly trimmed.\\nMales will keep nails trimmed so as not to extend beyond\\nthe fingertip.\\nFemales will not exceed a nail length of 1\u20444 inch (6.35 mm)\\nas measured from the tip of the finger.

Customs and Courtesies\\nSaluting\\nThe origin of the hand salute is uncertain. Some historians\\nbelieve it began in late Roman times when assassinations\\nwere common. A citizen who wanted to see a public official\\nhad to approach with his right hand raised to show that he\\ndid not hold a weapon. Knights in armor raised visors with\\nthe right hand when meeting a comrade. This practice\\ngradually became a way of showing respect and in early\\nAmerican history sometimes involved removing the hat. By\\n1820, the motion was modified to touching the hat, and\\nsince then has become the hand salute used today.\\nWhile in the Army, you salute to show respect toward an\\nofficer, flag, or our country. The proper way to salute with or\\nwithout a weapon is described in Training Circular 3-21.5.\\nSee AR 600-25, for when to salute.\\nFollow these rules:\\nWhen you meet someone outside, salute as soon as you\\nrecognize that they are an officer, or if you are walking\\ntoward the officer, wait until you are about six steps away.\\nSalute all officers (recognized by rank) in official vehicles\\nidentified by special plates or flags.\\nSalute only on command when in a formation.\\nIf in a group and an officer approaches, the first Soldier to\\nrecognize the officer calls the group to attention and all\\npersonnel salute.\\n93TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nIf you approach an officer while you are double-timing alone,\\nassume quick time, render the hand salute and give the\\nproper greeting. When the salute is returned, execute order\\narms and resume double-time.\\nThe salute is always initiated by the subordinate and\\nterminated only after acknowledgment by the individual\\nsaluted.\\nAccompany the salute with an appropriate greeting, such\\nas, \"good morning/afternoon, sir /ma\\'am.\"\\nSalutes are not required to be rendered by or to personnel\\nwho are driving or riding in privately owned vehicles.\\nIt is not customary for enlisted personnel to exchange\\nsalutes, except in some ceremonial situations.\\nNever render a salute with a noticeable object in your mouth\\nor right hand.\\nIf you are on detail and an officer approaches, salute if you\\nare in charge of the detail. Otherwise, continue to work.\\nWhen spoken to, come to the position of attention while\\naddressing an officer.\\nHand salute\\nThe Hand Salute is a one-count movement. The command\\nis \u201cPresent, ARMS\u201d. The Hand Salute may be executed\\nwhile marching. When marching, only the Soldier in charge\\nof the formation salutes.\\n94TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nFigure 6-1. Hand salute\\nWhen wearing headgear with a visor (with or without\\nglasses), on the command of execution ARMS, raise the\\nright hand sharply, fingers and thumb extended and joined,\\npalm facing down, and place the tip of the right forefinger on\\nthe rim of the visor slightly to the right of the right eye. The\\nouter edge of the hand is barely canted downward so that\\nneither the back of the hand nor the palm is clearly visible\\nfrom the front. The hand and wrist are straight, the elbow\\ninclined slightly forward, and the upper arm horizontal.\\nWhen wearing headgear without a visor (or uncovered) and\\nnot wearing glasses, execute the Hand Salute in the same\\nmanner as previously described, except touch the tip of the\\nright forefinger to the forehead near and slightly to the right\\nof the right eyebrow.\\nWhen wearing headgear without a visor (or uncovered) and\\nwearing glasses, execute the Hand Salute in the same\\nmanner as previously described, except touch the tip of the\\nright forefinger to that point on the glasses where the temple\\npiece of the frame meets the right edge of the right brow.\\n95TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nOrder Arms\\nOrder Arms from the Hand Salute is a one-count movement.\\nThe command is \u201cOrder, ARMS\u201d. On the command of\\nexecution ARMS, return the hand sharply to the side,\\nresuming the Position of Attention.\\nWhen reporting or rendering courtesy to an individual, turn\\nthe head and eyes toward the person addressed and\\nsimultaneously salute. In this situation, the actions are\\nexecuted without command. The Salute is initiated by the\\nsubordinate at the appropriate time (six paces) and\\nterminated upon acknowledgment.\\nRendering customs and courtesies to NCOs and\\nWarrant Officers\\nWhen addressing an NCO you need to be at the position of\\nParade Rest. The NCO may direct you to at ease, stand at\\nease, or rest.\\nWhen walking with someone of higher rank, walk on the left\\nside of the individual.\\nAlways greet individuals with the greeting of the day. Be\\nrespectful at all times.\\nWarrant Officers are treated in the same respect as Officers.\\nRendering Honor to the Flag\\nThe flag of the U.S. is the symbol of our Nation. The union,\\nwhite stars on a field of blue, is the honor point of the flag.\\nThe union of the flag and the flag itself, when in company\\nwith other flags, is always given the honor position; such as,\\nthe marching right, the flag\u2019s own right, or an observer\u2019s left\\nwhen facing the flag.\\n96TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nThe flag of the U.S. is displayed outdoors at all Army\\ninstallations.\\nThe flag is displayed daily from reveille to retreat. If\\nilluminated, it may be displayed at night during special\\nevents or on special occasions deemed appropriate by the\\ncommander.\\nWhen the flag is raised in the morning or lowered in the\\nevening, stand at attention on the first note of Reveille or\\n\"To the Colors.\u201d \"Colors\" refers to the flag of the U.S. and\\ncan include the unit flag. Give the required salute. You\\nnormally face the flag when saluting unless duty requires\\nyou to face in some other direction. At the conclusion of the\\nceremony, resume your regular duties.\\nThe flag, when flown at half-staff, is hoisted to the peak/top\\nof the flagpole and then lowered to the half-staff position. At\\nthe end of the day, the flag is hoisted to the peak before\\nlowered. \"Half-staff\" means lowering the flag to one-half the\\ndistance between the top and bottom of the staff.\\nWhenever Reveille or To the Colors are played, and you are\\nnot in formation and not in a vehicle, come to attention at\\nthe first note, face the flag, and give the required salute. If\\nno flag is near, face the music and salute. If you are in\\nformation, salute only on the order \"Present arms.\u201d If you are\\nin civilian clothing, stand at attention and place your right\\nhand over your heart.\\nCourtesies\\nThe following rules will help you conduct yourself\\nappropriately in the presence of officers and those senior in\\nrank:\\n97TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nWhen talking to an Officer or Warrant Officer, stand at\\nattention unless given the order \"At ease\u201d. When you are\\ndismissed, or when the officer departs, come to attention\\nand salute.\\nWhen an officer enters a room, the first Soldier to recognize\\nthe officer calls personnel in the room to attention but does\\nnot salute. When indoors a Soldier only renders a salute\\nwhen reporting to the officer or part of a ceremony requiring\\nsaluting.\\nWhen accompanying a senior, walk on his left.\\nWhen an officer enters a dining facility, unless he directs\\notherwise or a more senior officer is already present, the\\ndiners will be given the order \"At ease\" by the first person\\nwho sees the officer. You will remain seated at ease and\\ncontinue eating unless the officer directs otherwise. If you\\nare directly addressed, you should rise to attention when\\nseated in a chair. If you are seated on a bench, stop eating\\nand sit at attention until the conversation ends.\\nNote: The officer or NCO may give the directive \"Carry on.\u201d\\nThis means the Soldier or Soldiers should continue with\\nwhatever they were doing previously. This same directive is\\nused in many other situations outside of formation, such as\\nin the barracks and break areas.\\nWhen outdoors and approached by an NCO, you should\\nstand (when seated) and greet the NCO by saying, \"good\\nmorning, sergeant,\" \"good afternoon, sergeant,\" or \"good\\nevening, sergeant (last name, if known).\"\\nWhile going through BCT, you will address all drill sergeants\\nas \u201cDrill Sergeant\u201d.\\n98TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nWhen you report to an officer and you are outdoors,\\napproach the officer, stop about two steps from him/her, and\\nassume the position of attention. Give the proper salute and\\nsay, for example, \"Sir/Ma\\'am, Private Smith reports.\u201d If you\\nare indoors, use the same procedures as above, except\\nremove your headgear before reporting.\\n6-3. Bugle Calls\\nBugle calls are the musical signals that announce scheduled\\nand certain non-scheduled events on an Army installation.\\nScheduled calls are prescribed by the installation\\ncommander. According to Army customs, bugle calls\\ntraditionally signal troops for everything from mealtimes and\\nrecall formations, to rendering honors to the nation. Bugle\\ncalls normally sound in accordance with the major calls of\\nthe day-Reveille, Retreat, and Taps.\\nReveille\\nThe call signals the troops to awaken for morning roll call.\\nMost often heard at physical training, it is used to\\naccompany the raising of the National Colors. If outdoors at\\nthe first sound of Reveille, you should come to the position\\nof attention and salute, facing the flag or the sound of the\\nmusic. If not in uniform, come to attention and place your\\nright hand over your heart.\\nRetreat\\nThe call signals the end of the duty day and lowering of the\\nNational Colors. If alone, you should come to attention in the\\ndirection of the music or flag. Then, salute when you hear\\nthe first note of music after the cannon sounds. If not in\\n99TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nuniform, come to attention and place your right hand over\\nyour heart.\\nTaps\\nThe call signals that unauthorized lights are to be\\nextinguished. It is the last call of the day. If indoors there is\\nno need to stand at attention and salute. The call is also\\nsounded at the completion of a military funeral ceremony.\\nYou should come to attention and salute until the music\\ncompletes. If not in uniform, come to attention and place\\nyour right hand over your heart.\\n6-4. Drill and Ceremonies\\nMany drill procedures used by the U.S. Army today were\\ndeveloped during the Revolutionary War. The purpose of\\nthe drill then was to instill discipline in American Soldiers. As\\nthese Soldiers mastered the art of the drill, they began to\\nwork as a team and develop a sense of pride in themselves\\nand in their unit.\\nIn today\\'s Army, the same objectives\u2013teamwork,\\nconfidence, pride, alertness, attention to detail, esprit de\\ncorps, and discipline are accomplished by drill.\\nA drill consists of a series of movements by which a unit or\\nindividuals are moved in an orderly, uniform manner from\\none formation or place to another. Units vary in size, but in\\nBCT, you will ordinarily be part of a squad, platoon,\\ncompany, or battalion.\\nStrengthen Soldier proficiency with Army customs and\\ncourtesies and continue to enculturate pride in discipline\\nwithin the force.\\n100TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nYou will need to know the following drill terms:\\nElement is an individual, squad, section, platoon, company,\\nor larger unit formed as part of the next higher unit.\\nFormation is an arrangement of the unit\\'s elements in a\\nprescribed manner such as a line formation in which the\\nelements are side-by-side, or a column formation in which\\nthe elements are one behind the other. In a platoon column,\\nthe members of each squad are one behind the other with\\nthe squads abreast.\\nFront is a space from one side to the other side of a\\nformation and includes the right and left elements.\\nDepth is a space from the front to the rear of a formation,\\nincluding the front and rear elements.\\nDistance is the space between elements that are one\\nbehind the other. The distance between individuals is an\\n(914.4 mm) arm\\'s length, plus 6 inches (152.4 mm), or\\n101TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\napproximately 36 inches (914.4 mm) measured from the\\nchest of one Soldier to the back of the Soldier immediately\\nto his front.\\nInterval is the space between side-by-side elements.\\nRank is a line that is only one element in depth.\\nFile is a column that has a front of one element.\\nGuide is the person responsible for maintaining the\\nprescribed direction and rate of march.\\nPost is the correct place for an officer or NCO to stand in a\\nprescribed formation.\\nHead is a column\\'s leading element. Base is the element.\\nCadence is a uniform rhythm or number of steps or counts\\nper minute.\\nQuick Time is a cadence of 120 counts (steps per minute)\\naround which a movement is planned or regulated.\\nDouble Time is a cadence of 180 counts (steps per\\nminute).\\nDrill commands are oral orders given by your commander\\nor leader, usually in two parts. The preparatory command\\nstates the movement to be carried out and gets you ready to\\nexecute the order. The command of execution tells when\\nthe movement is to be carried out. In the command\\n\u201cForward, march,\u201d the preparatory command is \u201cForward,\u201d\\nthe command of execution is \u201cMarch.\u201d\\n102TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nFigure 6-2. Drill and ceremony position\\nIn some commands, the preparatory command and the\\ncommand of execution are combined. For example, \u201cfall in,\u201d\\n\u201cat ease,\u201d and \u201crest.\u201d These commands are given without\\ninflection and at a uniformly high pitch and loudness\\ncomparable to that of a normal command of execution.\\nIf you are in a group of three or more, marching is required\\nwhen moving from one location to another.\\n103TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nMost marching movements are a five-step process. This can\\nbe simplified into the acronym PICAA:\\nP-preparatory command\\nI-intermediate step\\nC-command of execution\\nA-action step\\nA-additional step.\\nPut simply, the Preparatory command, the command of\\nexecution and the action step\u2014executing the movement\u2014\\nare all given or executed when the same foot strikes the\\nmarching surface. The Intermediate step and Additional step\\nare executed with the other foot.\\nChapter 7 \u2013 Physical Readiness\\nThe Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F) System recognizes\\nthat Soldier readiness depends on the proper combinations\\nof physical fitness (such as strength, speed, and endurance)\\nand foundational health (such as the cardiovascular,\\nrespiratory, immune, and hormonal systems) that are\\noptimized through careful attention to nutritional readiness,\\nmental readiness, spiritual readiness, and sleep readiness.\\nNutrition\u2014the food, beverages, and supplements in a\\nSoldier\u2019s diet\u2014provides the nutrients needed to meet the\\nphysical demands of training and combat. Soldiers must\\nalso maintain mental readiness\u2014the exceptional mental\\n104TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nflexibility and endurance, outstanding self-initiative and\\nsuperior judgment required in combat. Spiritual readiness\\nsupports individual and collective readiness as Soldiers\\nnegotiate challenging moral and ethical situations in training\\nor operational environments. Finally, proper sleep sustains\\nbrain function, cognition (thought processing), the immune\\nsystem, and recovery after physical activity.\\n7-1. Army Physical Fitness Uniform (APFU)\\nThe components of the APFU are:\\n1. Jacket, running, black and gold.\\n2. Pants, running, black.\\n3. Trunks, running, black, moisture-wicking.\\n4. T-shirt, black, short sleeve, moisture-wicking.\\n5. T-shirt, black, long sleeve, moisture-wicking.\\n6.

Performance Nutrition\\nThe Army\u2019s Holistic Health and Fitness System (H2F)\\nhighlights Nutritional Readiness as a key component to\\nSoldier performance (FM 7-22). Nutritional readiness is the\\nability to recognize, select, and consume the necessary\\nfoods and fluids to meet the physical and nonphysical\\ndemands of any duty or combat position, accomplish the\\nmission, and come home healthy.\\nFuel your body for optimal performance\\nAs a Soldier athlete, you are expected to achieve and\\nmaintain a high level of fitness and readiness. Fitness is\\nnot only achieved by your training, but also how you fuel\\n(with food) and hydrate (with fluid) your body. Fueling\\nwith performance limiting foods (such as \u201cjunk\u201d foods or\\nmost vending machine items, regular sodas, energy\\ndrinks, most fast-food options, fried foods, etc.) leads to\\nmental and physical fatigue and could contribute to\\ninjuries and illnesses.\\nOptimal fueling requires a little knowledge, a little\\ndiscipline, and a whole lot of dedication to caring for the\\nArmy\u2019s most important weapons system\u2014YOU!\\nFueling with the right amount of carbohydrates, protein,\\nand healthful fats promotes energy, endurance, stamina,\\nand muscle growth. Benefits of proper fueling include:\\n\u2022 Maintaining a lean body composition\\n111TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 Decreasing post-exercise muscle soreness\\n\u2022 Stronger and healthier muscles\\nFigure 8-1.

Iron\\nmakes it possible for cells to carry oxygen to the body\\'s\\ntissues. When iron levels are low, you may feel weak, tired,\\nand irritable. The best sources of iron are the foods you eat.\\nMost female trainees and athletes do not consume\\nenough iron to meet their nutritional needs. Thus,\\nhealthcare providers will provide female trainees with a\\nprescription for a daily MVI (prenatal vitamin). Taking\\nthe MVI is voluntary, but highly recommended. Benefits\\nof a MVI may include:\\nImproved energy during training.\\nImproved physical fitness performance.\\nIncreased likelihood of on-time graduation.\\nImproved concentration.\\nWhy are males not given the MVI?\\nMost men have 4-5 times the amount of\\nrecommended iron stores and can manage the\\nincreased iron demand of basic combat training with\\nfood alone.\\n118TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nFigure 8-4. Multivitamin with Iron content and size\\nStay hydrated\\nFluid needs vary greatly from person to person, and\\ndepend on intensity of work, level of heat stress, and\\nsweat rates.\\nThe first step in hydration is to drink fluids and eat foods high\\nin water content throughout the day.\\nCool water is the beverage of choice for maintaining\\nhydration. Recommended fluid intake ranges from 2 to 5\\nquarts (64-160 ounces) per day. For reference, a\\ncanteen holds 1 quart of fluid, an issued hydration pack\\nholds ~3 quarts.\\n\u2022 Drink regularly or whenever possible during\\nexercise, training, and operations. Drink 16\u201332\\nounces of fluid every 60 minutes during activity\\nto stay hydrated.\\n\u2022 Performance declines with slight dehydration.\\n119TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 To rehydrate (replace fluids) after exercise, drink\\nliquids and eat foods that contain fluids. Consume\\nabout 20\u201324 ounces of fluid for every pound of\\nweight you lost.\\n\u2022 Drinking too much plain water or not consuming\\nenough sodium can lead to hyponatremia (low\\nsodium levels in your blood), a potentially serious\\ncondition.\\nElectrolytes control the fluid balance of the body and are\\nimportant in muscle contraction, among many other\\nessential functions. Electrolytes (sodium, potassium,\\ncalcium, magnesium, and chloride) are found in food and\\nfluids. The loss of sodium and potassium in sweat can be\\nquite high during prolonged physical activity, especially in\\nwarm weather. It\u2019s important to choose foods and\\nbeverages that contain sodium and other electrolytes to\\npromote faster and more complete recovery. Drinking too\\nmuch plain water or not consuming enough sodium can\\nresult in hyponatremia (low sodium levels in your blood),\\nwhich requires immediate medical attention to reduce risk of\\nserious illness or death.\\nHyponatremia typically occurs during physical activities of\\nlonger duration. Symptoms, which can be severe, include\\nheadache, vomiting, swollen hands and feet, fatigue,\\nconfusion, disorientation, and breathing problems. Keep in\\nmind that some symptoms of hyponatremia are similar to\\nthe symptoms of dehydration, so be mindful of how much\\nand how often you drink fluids.

During your first void (or\\nurination) of the day, if you see that your urine is dark, you\\nneed to drink more fluids or eat more foods with a high-\\nwater content. Recommended fluids: water, sports drinks,\\n100% fruit juice, milk, milk alternatives (soy, almond).\\nRecommended foods: fruits and vegetables, soup, yogurt\\n121TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nFigure 8-5.

Energy drinks generally contain\\nlarge quantities of caffeine and may contain other\\ningredients, most of which do absolutely nothing to enhance\\nperformance or health. Also, the large quantities of caffeine\\ncan aggravate dehydration, and may lead to increased\\nanxiety, upset stomach, shakiness, headaches, and sleep\\nissues.\\nThese potential side effects can reduce your ability to\\nperform, NOT enhance it. Instead of reaching for energy\\ndrinks, it\u2019s best to feed your body energy throughout the\\nday:\\n\u2022 Snack on carbohydrates and energy-rich foods such\\nas dried fruits, nuts, trail mix, a commercial sports\\nbar or low-fat chocolate milk.\\n\u2022 Drink cool, plain water frequently, even if you aren\u2019t\\nthirsty.\\nDietary supplements\\nMany Soldiers use dietary supplements to improve\\nperformance, increase muscle mass, enhance energy,\\naccelerate recovery, increase alertness, boost their immune\\nsystem, and improve joint function. However, dietary\\nsupplements are not tested or approved by the Food and\\nDrug Administration prior to placement on the market, are\\noften unnecessary, and can be dangerous and expensive.\\n123TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nAlthough some dietary supplements can offer some\\nbenefits, others might be unsafe or contaminated with\\ndrugs, controlled substances, or other ingredients not\\nlisted on the label.

Sleep\\nThe disciplined practices in sleep, activity, and nutrition\\ncomprise the Army\u2019s \u201cperformance triad.\u201d By following the\\nhabits outlined below you maximize performance and avoid\\nillness and injury.\\nMake Sleep A Priority - Sleep is a biological need for brain\\nfunctioning and is critical to sustain the mental abilities\\nrequired for success in BCT and advanced individual\\ntraining. Soldiers require a minimum of 7-8 hours of sleep\\nevery 24-hours.\\nIn BCT, you can receive at least 7 hours of continuous sleep\\nper night (unless you are scheduled for duty such as access\\ncontrol guard/fireguard or charge of quarter\u2019s runner).\\nDuring field training, the length of the training day, and time\\nfor sleep will vary based on training requirements; however,\\nyour commander will ensure that the schedule allows\\nsufficient time for sleep during field training.\\nThe MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU MUST REMEMBER:\\nWhen you can sleep, do it. Insufficient sleep presents a risk\\nto mission success. Sleep deprived Soldiers are likely to\\nmake mission critical and sometimes fatal errors.\\n126TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nThe demanding nature of military operations often creates\\nsituations in which obtaining enough sleep on a regular\\nbasis is difficult or impossible. Such chronic, insufficient\\nsleep (anything less than 7-8 hours per 24 hours) produces\\na sleep debt \u2013 a chronic state of increased sleep need that\\nis characterized by impaired performance and readiness.\\nThe only way to eliminate the debt is to obtain sleep (just\\nclosing your eyes and resting is not the same as\\nsleeping/napping). As a Soldier you must make sleep a\\npriority!\\nWhen you can rest or sleep, do it.\\n8-3. Activity\\nDuring BCT you will obviously maintain a high level of\\nactivity. However, once you graduate from AIT or OSUT,\\nyou have much more control over your level of activity. You\\nwill need recreational-type activities to maintain your\\noptimum performance; Army physical readiness training and\\nthe other high-physical demands of your duties will not\\nprovide all the physical activity you need.\\nPhysical activity is more than just \u201cexercise\u201d or \u201cworking\\nout\u201d- it\u2019s living an active lifestyle. Whether it\u2019s walking the\\ndog, doing yard work, or playing with your kids, regular\\nmovement throughout the day inspires positive health\\noutcomes over time.\\nPhysical activity improves health in the following ways:\\n\u2022 Lowers risk of some chronic diseases and\\nconditions such as type 2 diabetes, high blood\\npressure, stroke, and cancer (for example, breast\\nand colon).\\n127TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 Aids in weight loss and prevents weight gain.\\n\u2022 Helps manage stress and may reduce depression.\\n\u2022 Strengthens bones, muscles, and joints.\\n\u2022 Boosts confidence and self-esteem.\\nAmount and types of physical activity. To receive positive\\nhealth outcomes, you need at least:\\n\u2022 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity\\nper week. 150 minutes is also: 2 hours and 30\\nminutes per week OR 30 minutes a day for 5 days\\nOR 10 minutes of activity 3 times a day for 5 days.\\n\u2022 2 days of muscle strengthening activities (like\\nweight/resistance band training, calisthenics, and\\nyoga).\\n\u2022 10,000 steps during your everyday routine. Note:\\n10,000 steps is close to 5 miles. An inactive person\\nmay only average 1,000 to 3,000 steps a day, or\\nabout one mile. Persons who walk less than this in a\\nnormal day should add walking to their routines.\\nSave time by bumping up the intensity. Perform 75 minutes\\nof vigorous-intensity activities per week (jogging, swimming\\nlaps, or hiking uphill).\\n\u2022 Pick activities you enjoy. Moderate-intensity\\nactivities include: brisk walking, doubles tennis, golf,\\nand leisure biking.\\n\u2022 Invite Family, friends, and fellow Soldiers to join\\nyou. Take a fitness class, join a recreation league,\\nsign up for a 5K run/walk, or start a walking group in\\nyour neighborhood.\\n128TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n8-4. Hygiene\\nIn addition to Army training, personal hygiene plays a crucial\\nrole in your overall physical readiness as a strong,\\nproductive Soldier. There are numerous health concerns\\nthat can arise if you do not conduct proper personal hygiene\\nat home and in field environments.\\nHazard of communicable diseases\\nCommunicable diseases are caused by specific infectious\\norganisms like viruses or bacteria transmitted from one\\nperson to another. The person who is infected may feel\\nand/or look sick or might carry the illness without feeling or\\nlooking sick at all. These diseases can rapidly degrade the\\nmedical readiness of Soldiers and entire military units\\npreventing them from achieving their mission. They also\\ncause significant suffering and overwhelm the military health\\ncare system.\\nYou received vaccinations to protect you against the\\nincreased risk of these infections when you entered the\\nArmy, and you will receive additional vaccinations prior to\\ntravel to foreign areas. There are many communicable\\nillnesses that do not have vaccines such as the common\\ncold and hepatitis C and D.\\nResistance to illness\\nVaccines do part of the job; the rest is up to you. Your\\nimmune system protects you from most illnesses. It\\ncontinues with things you do to protect yourself, like keeping\\nyourself and the environment clean; wearing a clean uniform\\nappropriate for the season; and avoiding contact with\\npersons who are ill. Also, you should always cough into your\\n129TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\narm and clean your hands frequently to avoid\\nspreading/receiving germs.\\nImmediate hazards to your health\\nDo not take chances with your health. If in doubt, get\\nmedical help. Injuries that pose a threat to your health or life\\nare:\\n\u2022 Any eye injury.\\n\u2022 Any human or animal bite that breaks the skin.\\n\u2022 Allergic reaction to an insect bite, chemicals, or\\nmedications.\\n\u2022 Bleeding that cannot be stopped.\\n\u2022 Burns, including severe sunburn.\\n\u2022 Feeling very hot and/or confused after being out in\\nthe heat.\\n\u2022 Exposure to cold temperatures and you think you\\nmay have a cold injury.\\nOther symptoms of illnesses that can threaten your health or\\nlife include:\\n\u2022 Tightness, pressure, or pain in your chest that\\nspreads to your neck, jaw, arm, or back.\\n\u2022 Shortness of breath or wheezing while resting.\\n\u2022 Difficulty breathing, or the feeling of choking.\\n\u2022 Coughing up blood.\\n\u2022 Difficulty speaking, swallowing, or opening your\\nmouth.\\n130TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 Stiff neck with fever.\\n\u2022 Sudden loss of vision.\\n\u2022 Very bad pain anywhere on your body.\\n\u2022 Weakness and dizziness.\\n\u2022 Blood in your urine or brown urine.\\n\u2022 Vomiting up blood or what looks like coffee grounds.\\n\u2022 Blood in your stool or black, tar-like stools.\\n\u2022 You feel like you might hurt yourself or others.\\n\u2022 Hip or knee injuries.\\n\u2022 Painful teeth or swelling in your mouth or jaw.\\nIf you experience any injuries or symptoms of illness, report\\nthem to your drill sergeant immediately to receive health\\ncare.\\nBathe/shower daily\\nRegular bathing with soap and water is important for both\\ncleanliness and personal appearance.\\nBathing prevents hygiene-related diseases such as scabies,\\nringworm, athlete\u2019s foot, skin infections, and pink eye.\\nYou should wash your hands, face and ears, armpits, groin,\\nand feet. In addition to washing your skin regularly you\\nshould wash your hair at least twice a week, shave daily and\\navoid sharing combs or razors with others.\\nWash hands regularly\\nNormally your immune system protects you against invasion\\nby bacteria, viruses, and parasites. However, if your hands\\n131TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nbecome contaminated with these organisms and you put\\nthem up to your nose or mouth, disease and germs can\\ninvade your body and cause an infection.\\nMany aspects of basic training can make you more\\nvulnerable to respiratory illnesses to include close contact\\nwith other Soldiers.\\nThe physical and psychological stresses of military training\\ncan make you more vulnerable to illness. In addition, your\\nimmune system may not be able to withstand the new\\norganisms you are exposed to when first brought together\\nas a group.\\nAlmost 90 percent of Soldiers get symptoms of respiratory\\nillness at some point during BCT. In most cases, these\\nillnesses are mild, and trainees can continue training, but\\nsometimes they progress to worse infections like pneumonia\\nor meningitis.\\nWashing your hands with soap and water is the most\\neffective way to prevent the spread of bacteria and viruses\\nwhich are major cause of food borne diseases and other\\nillnesses. Although the use of hand sanitizers is effective for\\nkilling most of these harmful organisms on the hands, they\\nare ineffective on hands that are heavily soiled with dirt,\\ngrease, and other debris. Therefore, the use of hand\\nsanitizers should not be used in place of hand washing,\\nrather as a supplement to or a temporary alternative when\\nhand washing is not available.\\nWash or sanitize your hands every time:\\n\u2022 After using the latrine\\n\u2022 Before eating or handling food\\n132TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 After sneezing or blowing your nose\\nIt is important to practice good hygiene habits when you are\\nin basic training. It becomes more difficult to wash your\\nhands and bathe regularly when you are in the field or\\ndeployed.\\nDental health and readiness\\nBrush and floss your teeth.\\nKeeping a healthy mouth maintains dental readiness and\\nensures you will not suffer from pain, infection, or inability to\\neat high-performance foods. Poor oral health takes more\\nSoldiers out of the fight than the enemy does.\\nWisdom teeth and gum disease cause problems. However\\nmost dental emergencies are caused by tooth decay or its\\ncomplications.\\nTooth decay is caused by bacteria (germs) that feed on\\nstarchy or sugary snacks and beverages, and by acids that\\nwear away the surfaces of teeth. Soda, juice, sweet tea,\\nsports drinks, and energy drinks all contain sugar and acids\\nthat can damage teeth.\\nSaliva is critical for protecting your teeth from decay by\\nneutralizing acids, hardening teeth, and fighting germs.\\nStressful training or operations can decrease saliva flow,\\nleaving you vulnerable to decay.\\nPrevent dental problems in three ways: watch what you put\\nin your mouth, wear mouth guards during training activities,\\nand clean your mouth every day.\\n133TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nFollow the guidelines in the Nutrition section above and\\ncontribute toward a healthy mouth.\\nYour teeth and gums need the same water intake, calcium,\\nvitamins and minerals, and protein that the rest of your body\\nneeds as well as protection from sugars, acid content, and\\nsimple starches. Do not sip them throughout the day.\\nIn addition to a healthy diet:\\n\u2022 Limit sugary drinks. If you have them, drink them in\\none setting with a straw and rinse out with water\\nafterwards.\\n\u2022 Rinse your mouth with plain water after drinking\\nsugary drinks.\\n\u2022 If you drink juice, choose juice that has calcium\\nadded to minimize acid damage.\\n\u2022 Use sugar free gum or mints.\\n\u2022 Avoid tobacco. Tobacco can cause gum disease\\nand oral cancer.\\n\u2022 Use lip balm with sunscreen during sun exposure to\\nprevent lip cancer.\\nClean your mouth every day:\\n\u2022 Brush 2-3 times a day, every day, with fluoride\\ntoothpaste to remove food particles and harmful\\nbacteria from your teeth. Fluoride helps repair early-\\nstage tooth decay and makes tooth structure more\\nresistant to tooth decay.\\n\u2022 Brush before going to sleep to provide greater\\nprotection for your teeth.\\n134TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 Use a soft or ultra-soft toothbrush that is small\\nenough to fit around your back teeth.\\n\u2022 Brush your teeth for about 2-3 minutes using a\\ngentle, circular motion. Pay extra attention to the\\ngum-line, back teeth, and areas around fillings,\\ncrowns, or bridges.\\n\u2022 Brush your tongue and the roof of your mouth to\\nremove germs that cause tooth decay and bad\\nbreath.\\n\u2022 If you have an appliance such as an orthodontic\\nretainer or partial denture, remove it before brushing\\nyour teeth. Brush all surfaces of the appliance also.\\n\u2022 Do not rinse your mouth after brushing. Just spit\\nseveral times to remove excess toothpaste.\\n\u2022 Don\u2019t eat or drink anything for at least 30 minutes\\nafter you brush so the fluoride will stay on your teeth\\nlonger and protect them better.\\n\u2022 If you can\u2019t brush:\\nSwish with water after eating or drinking.\\no\\nWipe your teeth with a clean cloth wrapped\\no\\naround your finger.\\nRub toothpaste on the surfaces of your teeth\\no\\nwith your finger.\\n\u2022 Floss once a day. Flossing removes bacteria and\\nfood in between teeth and areas a toothbrush can\u2019t\\nreach.\\n135TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 Use 18 inches (457.2 mm) of floss. Wrap the end of\\nthe floss around your middle finger and use your\\nindex finger to guide the floss.\\n\u2022 Insert the floss between your teeth. Gently pull from\\nside to side to get it through the tight spots, Use a\\ndifferent area of the floss for each space.\\n\u2022 Gently move the floss up and down against the\\ntooth in back, then the tooth in front.\\n\u2022 Wrap the floss around the teeth as you\u2019re moving it\\nup and down gently.\\n\u2022 Your gums may bleed at first when you start flossing\\nevery day. If bleeding continues after a week or two\\nsee your dentist.\\nRemember, you can minimize the risk for cavities. When a\\ndentist identifies a problem at your annual exam, get it\\ntreated as soon as possible.\\nNote: Females should be extra vigilant about brushing with\\nfluoride toothpaste 2-3 times a day to prevent cavities and\\nbleeding gums.\\nFemales tend to make less saliva than males which leaves\\nthem more vulnerable to tooth decay.\\nFluctuations in female hormones can also negatively affect\\noral health. Hormones and oral contraceptives can increase\\nbacteria levels in the mouth and cause changes in the blood\\nvessels in the gums, leading to gingivitis.\\nFemale hormones impact the mouth\u2019s reaction to bacteria\\nand can increase bacteria symptoms during monthly\\n136TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nhormonal fluctuations resulting in tenderness, swelling, and\\nbleeding when brushing.\\nFemales who use oral contraceptives are also twice as likely\\nto develop a painful condition called \u201cdry socket\u201d after dental\\nextraction.\\nHormone fluctuations and stressful environments are\\nassociated with development of painful mouth ulcers or\\ncanker sores.\\nNutritional deficiencies (vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12, C, folate,\\niron, magnesium, or zinc) may also increase your risk of\\ndeveloping mouth ulcers.\\nOver-the-counter remedies are effective for the discomfort\\ncaused by small ulcers and can be obtained at dental sick\\ncall. Larger or more painful ulcers may interfere with a\\nnormal diet.\\nA dentist can prescribe medicine to reduce pain and\\naccelerate healing of larger ulcers.\\nCare for your feet and nails\\nAthlete\u2019s foot is caused by a fungus that lives in damp,\\nwarm, and dark areas like shower rooms, rubber boots, and\\nin some cases, older or poorly maintained running shoes.\\nAthlete\u2019s foot usually looks like small blisters between the\\ntoes. These can pop, causing itching and little sharp pains.\\nThe skin may crack or look scaly.\\nYou can get athlete\u2019s foot from walking barefoot on unclean\\nfacilities and not washing your feet.\\n137TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nThe symptoms include itching, flaking skin, and cracking\\nbetween toes or on bottom of feet.\\nDo the following to prevent Athlete\u2019s foot:\\n\u2022 Wear shower shoes when taking showers and\\nwalking on the floor.\\n\u2022 Use a towel to dry thoroughly between your toes.\\n\u2022 Wear clean dry socks; never wear another Soldier\u2019s\\nsocks.\\n\u2022 Clean the showers and latrine floors daily.\\n\u2022 Sprinkle foot powder in your socks to help absorb\\nthe moisture.\\n\u2022 Remove the inserts from your boots at night to\\nprevent fungus from growing.\\nIf you get athlete\u2019s foot, an anti-fungal solution or cream is\\nneeded to treat it.\\nAlternate your boots daily. Wear one pair of boots one day\\nand change to your other pair the next day.\\nIn addition to preventing athlete\u2019s foot, make sure you\\nprevent ingrown toenails. Ingrown toenails are caused by a\\ncombination of tight shoes and trimming the toenails down\\nto the edge of the nail.\\nSymptoms include tenderness, swelling, sharp pain,\\nredness, and discharge.\\nYou can prevent ingrown toenails by trimming nails straight\\nacross every two weeks. Cut toenails short and square.\\n138TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nSeek medical attention for treatment for ingrown nails.\\nSurgery may be necessary to remove the nail from the skin.\\nPrevent blisters\\nBlisters are caused by friction from tight fitting shoes,\\nbreaking in new boots, and/or road marches.\\nSymptoms are redness and tenderness of the skin.\\nBlisters can be minimized.\\nWearing proper fitting boots and tight fitting, clean, dry\\nsocks free of excessive wear can prevent most blisters.\\nSecond skin (mole skin) on \u201chot spots,\u201d knee-high nylons,\\nand good personal hygiene reduces blisters as well.\\nTo prevent blisters on the hands, wear work gloves when\\noperating equipment that requires repetitive movements,\\nsuch as raking or shoveling.\\nTake the following measures to treat a blister:\\n\u2022 Wash with a mild soap and water. Keep your skin\\nclean and dry. Apply a topical anti-biotic ointment to\\nprevent infection.\\n\u2022 Cover with bandage or second skin to prevent from\\nopening.\\n\u2022 DO NOT purposely open a blister.\\n\u2022 If blister opens, treat as you would any open cut.\\n\u2022 Always leave the top skin of a drained blister.\\n\u2022 Pulling off the top layer of skin can damage the new\\nskin underneath and cause infection.\\n139TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nProtect your hearing\\nSurvival on the battlefield could depend on your ability to\\nhear. Hearing loss caused by noise is painless, progressive,\\npermanent, but also preventable.\\nTo protect your hearing, insert your earplugs correctly\\nwhenever instructed to wear them.\\nDo not lose your earplugs. If you do lose your earplugs,\\nnotify your drill sergeant immediately to obtain another pair.\\nAlways wear your earplugs to protect your hearing when\\naround loud noises such as generators and\\nweapons/ranges.\\nProtect against the effects of heat, cold and insects\\nWhile in BCT and AIT, you may become exposed to\\nextreme heat, cold, and biting insects. To protect you from\\nthe effects of heat, cold, and insects your cadre will ensure\\nthe following:\\n\u2022 Safeguards against over-stress from heat, or over-\\nexposure to cold, especially in your first couple\\nweeks of training.\\n\u2022 Water and other beverages, and nutritious meals.\\nYou will likely drink more water and beverages than\\naccustomed.\\n\u2022 Protective clothing and sunscreen, and insect\\nrepellent. Your uniform is factory-treated with a\\nconventional insect repellent for clothing.\\n140TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 Instructions on what items of your uniform to wear,\\nand how much water you should drink on a given\\nday.\\n\u2022 Reminders about symptoms and signs of hot and\\ncold weather illnesses to watch for in both you and\\nyour buddy.\\n\u2022 Questions on illnesses or if you are taking\\nmedication that may increases the risk of heat and\\ncold weather illness.\\nNote: In case of a severe hot weather illness, your cadre\\nmay remove the outer clothing and apply ice water-soaked\\nsheets to the affected Soldier, this is a potentially lifesaving\\nmeasure.\\nHere are a few things to remember all the time:\\n\u2022 Eat all your meals and drink all the water and\\nbeverages provided to you. Food and fluids are\\nneeded to \u201cfuel\u201d your body\u2019s regulating systems for\\nboth heat and cold.\\n\u2022 Make sure your uniform is clean, worn as instructed,\\nand all buttons and fasteners are serviceable. Apply\\nsunscreen and insect repellent to your face, neck,\\nand hands as instructed.\\n\u2022 Let your cadre know if you aren\u2019t feeling well, taking\\nmedications, and/or have unusual insect bite marks\\nthat look infected.

Ready and Resilient\\nSoldiers must cope with adversity, perform well in stressful\\nsituations, and learn to thrive in stressful environments.\\nThe ready and resilient Fitness program is designed to build\\nresilience and enhance the performance of the Army Family\\n\u2013 Soldiers, their Families, and Army Civilians \u2013 through\\nhands-on training and online self-development tools.\\nResilient individuals enhance Army performance and\\nreadiness. Resilience is the ability to grow and thrive in the\\nface of challenges and bounce back from adversity.\\nThe goal of ready and resilient Family Fitness is to increase\\nyour resilience and enhance your performance by\\ndeveloping and strengthening five dimensions of strength.\\n1. Social strength refers to developing and maintaining\\ntrusted, valued relationships and friendships that are\\npersonally fulfilling and foster good communication including\\na comfortable exchange of ideas, views, and experiences.\\n2. Emotional strength means approaching life\u2019s\\nchallenges in a positive, optimistic way by demonstrating\\nself-control, stamina, and good character with your choices\\nand actions.\\n3. Family strength is about being a part of a Family unit\\nthat is safe, supportive, loving, and provides the resources\\nneeded for all members to live in a healthy and secure\\nenvironment.\\n152TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n4. Spiritual strength refers to one\u2019s purpose, values,\\nbeliefs, identity, and life vision. These elements, which\\ndefine the essence of a person, enable one to build inner\\nstrength, make meaning of experiences, behave ethically,\\npersevere through challenges, and be resilient when faced\\nwith adversity. An individual\u2019s spirituality draws upon\\npersonal, philosophical, psychological, and/or religious\\nteachings, and forms the basis of their character.\\n5. Physical strength is about performing and excelling in\\nphysical activities that require aerobic fitness, endurance,\\nstrength, healthy body composition, and flexibility derived\\nthrough exercise, nutrition, and training. The physical\\ndimension also encompasses the Office of the Surgeon\\nGeneral (OTSG) Performance Triad initiative of sleep,\\nactivity, and nutrition to improve personal and unit\\nperformance, resilience, and readiness.\\n8-8. Chaplains\\nThe chaplain is responsible for providing spiritual support to\\nevery Soldier in the unit. Although chaplains are part of a\\nparticular denomination, their mission is to ensure the\\nspiritual needs of every Soldier are met. Each battalion in\\nthe Army has its own chaplain (normally a CPT). The\\nchaplains and their assistants form the Unit Ministry Team.\\nChaplains hold weekly services (while in garrison and in the\\nfield), are available for individual counseling, and are one of\\nthe few members of the military who retain the privilege of\\nconfidentiality. The chaplain also plays a key role to help\\npromote programs, such as suicide prevention.\\n153TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nIn the BCT/OSUT/AIT environment, they are of value in\\nhelping Soldiers succeed under difficult and stressful\\nconditions. They assist the commander in teaching,\\ndisplaying, and instilling the Army Values and with\\nmaintaining high morale within the unit.\\n8-9. Risk management\\nEvery Soldier, regardless of rank, is faced with making\\ndecisions. You will be challenged to make informed\\ndecisions that consider both risk, and potential benefit. Your\\ndecisions not only affect you, but also your team, family, and\\nfriends.\\nFigure 8-10. Risk management cycle\\nThe Army uses a process called Risk Management to help\\nmake those decisions. Army Techniques Publication 5-19,\\n154TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nRisk Management is the Army\u2019s doctrinal manual for risk\\nmanagement.\\nThe decision-making process doesn\u2019t just apply in combat; it\\napplies to everything you do on or off duty. The goal is to\\npreserve the Army\\'s ability to fight and win by avoiding\\nunnecessary risk and making informed decisions at every\\nlevel. The Army\u2019s Risk Management process is a logical\\napproach to risk-associated decision making that helps you\\nmake smart risk decisions and reduce the possibility of\\nlosses.\\nAs you progress throughout your career, you will learn more\\nabout the risk management process. A few of the hazards\\nyou may encounter during IET include:\\n\u2022 Hot weather injury\\n\u2022 Cold weather injury\\n\u2022 Weapon-related hazards\\n\u2022 Environmental hazards (insects, animals, poisonous\\nplants, etc.)\\n____________________________________________\\nChapter 9 \u2013 Discipline\\nThe Army is subject to military law and the laws of our\\ngovernment, and we strive to live as law-abiding Soldiers in\\nwhatever we do and wherever we go.\\nDiscipline is the practice of our profession in the conduct of\\nduty, ethically, effectively, and efficiently meeting standards\\nwhile striving for excellence.\\n155TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nMilitary discipline is founded upon self-discipline, respect for\\nproperly constituted authority, and embracing the\\nprofessional Army Ethic with its supporting individual values.\\nMilitary discipline is instilled through positive leadership,\\nreinforcing the regulatory standards for personnel, and the\\ntraining readiness standards for individual and collective\\ntasks, together, resulting in a mental attitude about proper\\nconduct and obedience to lawful military authority.\\nWhile military discipline is the result of effective training, it is\\naffected by every feature of military life. It is manifested in\\nindividuals and units by:\\n\u2022 Cohesion, bonding, and a spirit of teamwork.\\n\u2022 Smartness of appearance and action.\\n\u2022 Cleanliness and maintenance of dress, equipment,\\nand quarters.\\n\u2022 Deference to seniors and mutual respect between\\nsenior and subordinate personnel.\\n\u2022 Prompt and willing execution of both the letter and\\nthe spirit of the legal orders of their lawful\\ncommanders.\\n\u2022 Fairness, justice, and equity for all Soldiers,\\nregardless of race, color, sex (including gender\\nidentity), national origin, religion, and sexual\\norientation.\\nThe Rules\\nThere are three basic rules you should follow:\\n\u2022 Follow Army regulations and the Uniform Code of\\nMilitary Justice (UCMJ).\\n156TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 Take responsibility for your actions.\\n\u2022 Set the example, do what is right even when no one\\nis watching, and always keep your hands to\\nyourself.\\nWhile military discipline is the result of effective training, it\\naffects every aspect of military life. It is a characteristic\\nfound in individuals and units that demonstrate:\\n\u2022 Unit cohesion, bonding, and a spirit of teamwork.\\n\u2022 Smartness of appearance and action.\\n\u2022 Cleanliness and maintenance of dress, equipment,\\nand quarters.\\n\u2022 Respect to seniors and mutual respect between\\nsenior and subordinate personnel.\\n\u2022 Prompt and willing execution of both the letter, and\\nthe spirit of the legal orders of their lawful\\ncommanders.\\n\u2022 Fairness, justice, and equity for all Soldiers,\\nregardless of age, race, ethnicity, religion, color,\\ngender, or national origin.\\nStandards of Conduct:\\n\u2022 Decisions and actions remain consistent with the\\nArmy Values, laws, and regulations.\\n\u2022 Strict obedience and prompt execution of the legal\\norders of their lawful seniors.\\n\u2022 Doing what is right even when no one is watching\\nand choosing the hard right over the easy wrong.\\n157TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 Accepting responsibility for your actions.\\n9-1. Non-Punitive Corrective Action\\nNonpunitive corrective measures are the primary tools for\\nteaching proper standards of conduct and performance and\\ndo not constitute punishment, nor are they required as a first\\nstep toward nonjudicial punishment. Included among\\nnonpunitive measures are denial of pass or other privileges,\\ncounseling, administrative reduction in grade, administrative\\nreprimands and admonitions, extra training, bar to continued\\nservice, and military occupational specialty (MOS)\\nreclassification.\\nOne of the most effective nonpunitive corrective measures\\nis extra training or instruction. For example, if Soldiers\\nappear in an improper uniform, they are required to correct it\\nimmediately; if they do not maintain their government\\nhousing area properly, they must correct the deficiency in a\\ntimely manner. If Soldiers have training deficiencies, they\\nare required to take extra training or instruction in subjects\\nrelated to the shortcoming. If a Soldier demonstrates minor\\nacts of indiscipline, physical exercise may be an acceptable\\nform of corrective training.\\nCorrective measures may be taken after normal duty hours.\\nSuch measures assume the nature of training or instruction,\\nnot punishment. Corrective training should continue only\\nuntil the training deficiency is overcome. Authority to use it is\\npart of the inherent powers of command.\\nUniform Code of Military Justice\\nSoldiers are subject not only to the laws of the United States\\nand host countries, but also the Uniform Code of Military\\nJustice (UCMJ). The UCMJ is a federal law that applies to\\n158TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nall Soldiers in an active-duty status, 24 hours a day and 7\\ndays a week, anywhere the world. Violations of Army\\nregulations, state and federal laws, and the orders of\\nsuperiors may constitute criminal conduct punishable under\\nthe UCMJ.\\nThe UCMJ enumerates a wide range of criminal offenses\\n(\u201cArticles\u201d) ranging from traditional crimes such as assault,\\ntheft, driving while intoxicated, disorderly conduct, murder,\\nand sexual assault; to military specific crimes such as\\nviolating a regulation, disrespect/insubordination,\\nfraternization, failure to pay debts, sexual harassment, and\\nany conduct that is prejudicial to good order and discipline\\nand/or of a nature to bring discredit to the service. The\\nUCMJ also establishes the various types of courts and sets\\nforth the procedures to be followed in the administration of\\nmilitary justice. You can find the UCMJ in Appendix 2 of the\\nU.S. Manual for Court Martial or in Title 10, United States\\nCode (USC), Sections 801-940.\\nUCMJ Article 15 authorizes commanders to impose non-\\njudicial punishment (NJP) for minor offenses when non-\\npunitive administrative corrective measures are inadequate\\ndue to the nature of the minor offense or because of the\\nservicemember\u2019s service record. Proceedings under Article\\n15 are not adversarial criminal prosecutions. This means\\nthat the hearing is not like a courtroom hearing (i.e., a court-\\nmartial). Neither the Soldier nor their spokesperson (or\\nretained lawyer) may examine or cross-examine witnesses\\nunless allowed by the commander and the commander is\\nnot bound by the formal rules of evidence.\\nThe UCMJ also authorizes commanders to convene court\\nmartials. Courts-martial are adversarial proceedings. That\\n159TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nis, lawyers representing the government and the accused\\npresent facts and arguments most favorable to each side. In\\ndoing so, they follow the rules of procedure and evidence.\\nThe judge decides questions of law. The court-martial\\nmembers apply the law and decide questions of fact.\\nUCMJ: Non-judicial punishment\\nNon-judicial punishment (NJP) is generally used to address\\n\u201cminor\u201d offenses related to intentional disregard of or failure\\nto comply with standards of military conduct.\\nOne of the purposes of NJP is to educate, correct, and\\nreform. It promotes positive behavior changes in Soldiers\\nwithout the stigma of a court-martial conviction.\\nWhether an offense is minor is within the discretion of the\\ncommander and depends on several factors including the\\nnature of the offense and the circumstances surrounding its\\ncommission; the offender\u2019s age, rank, duty assignment,\\nmilitary record, and experience; and the maximum sentence\\nimposable for the offensive if tried by court martial. Common\\nIET offenses punishable under Article 15 include\\ninsubordination, disrespect, fraternization, failure to report at\\nthe appointed time, and simple assault.\\nThe imposing commander will ensure that the Soldier is\\nnotified of the commander\u2019s intention to dispose of the\\nmatter pursuant to the provisions of UCMJ, Article 15, the\\nmaximum punishment, and the right to examine evidence,\\nseek counsel, present witnesses/evidence, and the right to\\ndemand a court-martial instead.\\nThe UCMJ, Article 15 proceedings are not adversarial in\\nnature. Soldiers may request an open or closed hearing.\\nThe Soldier is allowed to personally present matters in\\n160TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\ndefense, extenuation, or mitigation in the presence of the\\nimposing commander, except when appearance is\\nprevented by the unavailability of the commander or by\\nextraordinary circumstances.\\nPunishment may include extra duty, restriction, forfeitures of\\npay, reduction in rank, oral or written reprimand, and\\ncorrectional custody. Whether to impose punishment and\\nthe nature of the punishment are the sole decisions of the\\nimposing commander. Soldiers may choose to submit an\\nappeal of the Article 15 findings and punishment to the next\\nhigher commander.\\nUCMJ: Court-martial\\nCourts-martial, in general, are adversarial trial proceedings.\\nAt a court-martial, a trial counsel represents the\\ngovernment, and a defense counsel represents the\\naccused. The court-martial system consists of three types of\\ncourts-martial: a summary court-martial, a special court-\\nmartial, and a general court-martial. In determining the\\nappropriate type of court-martial, a convening authority\\nconsiders a variety of factors including the interests of good\\norder and discipline, and the severity of the charged\\noffense(s).\\nA summary court-martial (SCM) is a court composed of one\\nofficer who may or may not be a lawyer. The SCM handles\\nminor crimes of enlisted Soldiers only and has simple\\nprocedures. The maximum punishment, which depends\\nupon the rank of the accused, is limited to confinement for\\none month (for E4s and below), forfeiture of two-thirds pay\\nfor one month, and reduction in grade. An SCM may not try\\nan accused against their will. If the accused objects, the\\n161TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nSCM authority may consider trial by a higher court-martial.\\nThe accused does not have the right to military counsel at\\nan SCM, although he or she will see a trial defense attorney\\nbefore the court-martial. An SCM is a non-criminal forum\\nwhich means that a finding of guilty does not constitute a\\ncriminal conviction.\\nA special court-martial (SPCM) can try all Soldiers and\\nconsists of a military judge, four panel members (unless the\\naccused chooses to be tried by a military judge alone), a\\ntrial counsel, and a defense counsel. The maximum\\nsentence is a bad conduct discharge (BCD), confinement for\\ntwelve months, forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month for\\ntwelve months, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. If\\na BCD is adjudged, the accused has a right to an automatic\\nappeal to the Army Court of Criminal Appeals. A Convening\\nAuthority may also send a Soldier to judge only SPCM that\\nis not authorized to adjudge a punitive discharge with a\\nmaximum punishment of confinement not to exceed six\\nmonths, and forfeitures of pay not to exceed six months.\\nA general court-martial (GCM) tries cases over all Soldiers\\nfor the most serious offenses. It consists of a military judge,\\ntwelve members in a capital/death case and eight members\\nin a non-capital case (unless the accused elects to be tried\\nby a military judge alone), a trial counsel, and a defense\\ncounsel. Unless waived by the accused, a formal\\npreliminary hearing (an \u201cArticle 32\u201d hearing) must occur\\nbefore a GCM may try the case. The GCM may adjudge the\\nmost severe sentences authorized by law, including the\\ndeath penalty.\\n162TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n9-2. Military Equal Opportunity (MEO) Policy\\nThe MEO program ensures an Army-wide, concentrated\\neffort to maximize human potential and to ensure fair\\ntreatment for all persons based solely on merit, fitness, and\\ncapability in support of readiness.\\nThe MEO philosophy is based on fairness, justice, and\\nequity.\\nThe Army\u2019s MEO program emphasizes fair and equal\\ntreatment for military personnel, and civilian employees\\nwithout regard to race, color, religion, gender, or national\\norigin. This policy applies on and off post, extends to\\nSoldiers, civilian employees, and includes working, living,\\nand recreational environments.\\nComplaint process\\nThe MEO complaint processing system addresses\\ngrievances that allege unlawful discrimination or unfair\\ntreatment based on race, color, sex (to include gender\\nidentity), national origin, religion, or sexual orientation and\\nharassment, which includes hazing, bullying, and other\\ndiscriminatory harassment.\\nAlways attempt to resolve problems at the lowest possible\\nlevel in an organization.\\nAll submitted complaints are investigated. Personnel found\\nin violation of the MEO Policy are subject to punishment\\nunder the UCMJ.\\nWithin reason, Soldiers and other individuals are\\nencouraged to attempt resolution of any complaints by\\ndirectly addressing the alleged offender, or by informing\\n163TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nother appropriate officials about the offensive behavior or\\nunfair treatment.\\nKnowingly submitting a false complaint (a complaint\\ncontaining information or allegations that a Soldier knows to\\nbe false) may be punishable under UCMJ.\\nSoldiers must submit only legitimate complaints and should\\nexercise caution against frivolous or reckless allegations.\\nTypes of MEO complaints\\nThe Army has three types of complaints within the MEO\\ncomplaint process: anonymous, informal, and formal.\\nAn anonymous complaint is one in which the complainant\\nremains unidentified. It may be handled as either an\\ninformal or a formal complaint based on the Commander\u2019s\\ndiscretion. Actions taken regarding anonymous complaints\\nwill depend upon the extent of information provided in the\\nanonymous complaint.\\nAn informal complaint is any complaint that a Soldier does\\nnot wish to file in writing via DA Form 7279 (Equal\\nOpportunity and Harassment Complaint).\\nInformal complaints may be resolved by the complainant\\ndirectly with the assistance of another unit member, the\\ncommander, or another person in the complainant\\'s chain of\\ncommand.\\nTypically, those issues that may be taken care of informally\\nand can be resolved through discussion, problem\\nidentification, and clarification of the issues. An informal\\ncomplaint is still tracked in the MEO database.\\n164TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nA formal complaint is one that a complainant files in writing\\nusing a DA Form 7279 and swears to the accuracy of the\\ninformation.\\nFormal complaints require specific actions, are subject to\\ntimelines, and require documentation of the actions taken.\\nAlternative measures:\\nAlthough handling MEO complaints through the chain of\\ncommand is strongly encouraged, this is not the only\\nchannel available to Soldiers. Should a Soldier feel\\nuncomfortable in filing a complaint with the chain of\\ncommand, or should the complaint be against a member of\\nthe chain of command, there are several alternative\\nagencies through which a complaint can be made.\\nThe following agencies are frequently used:\\n\u2022 MEO professional\\n\u2022 Chaplain\\n\u2022 Provost Marshal\\n\u2022 Staff Judge Advocate\\n\u2022 Housing Referral Office\\n\u2022 Inspector General\\n\u2022 MEO Hotline\\nInspector General (IG): Serves as the eyes, ears, voice,\\nand conscience of the commander. The IG performs four\\nbasic functions: teaching and training; inspections;\\nassistance, and investigations. Providing the commander\\nimpartial fact findings to improve the Army and support the\\nChain of Command.\\n165TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nRight to appeal: If a complainant perceives an investigation\\nfailed to reveal all relevant facts, or if actions taken on their\\nbehalf are perceived as insufficient, they have the right to\\nappeal to the next higher commander.\\nThe complainant may not appeal the action taken against\\nthe perpetrator, if any is taken.\\n9-3. Policy on relationships between Soldiers:\\nArmy policy imposes many restrictions on senior-\\nsubordinate relationships. These restrictions are necessary\\nto maintain good order and discipline and to protect the\\nintegrity of the chain of command and the welfare of\\nSoldiers. See AR 600-20 and TRADOC Regulation 350-6,\\nfor more detailed policy on prohibited relationships and\\nactivities.\\nIn general, Soldiers of different grades in the Army must be\\ncognizant that their interactions do not create an actual or\\nclearly predictable perception of undue familiarity between\\nan officer and an enlisted Soldier, or between an NCO and a\\njunior enlisted Soldier. Army regulations prohibit any\\nrelationship between officers and enlisted Soldiers and\\nNCOs and junior enlisted Soldiers which results in the\\nfollowing effects:\\n\u2022 Compromise, or appear to compromise, the integrity\\nof supervisory authority or the chain of command.\\n\u2022 Cause actual or perceived partiality or unfairness.\\n\u2022 Involve, or appear to involve, the improper use of\\nrank or position for personal gain.\\n\u2022 Are, or are perceived to be, exploitative in nature.\\n166TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 Cause an actual or clearly predictable adverse\\nimpact on discipline, authority, morale, or the\\ncommand\u2019s ability to accomplish its mission.\\nCertain types of relationships between officers and enlisted\\nSoldiers or between NCOs and junior enlisted Soldiers are\\nautomatically prohibited.

The Code of Conduct\\nThe Code of Conduct is our guide for how all Soldiers,\\nSailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard must conduct\\nthemselves if captured by the enemy. The Code of\\nConduct, in six brief articles addresses the intense\\nsituations and decisions that to some degree, all military\\nservices members could encounter. It contains the critical\\ninformation for U.S. prisoners of war to survive honorably\\nwhile faithfully resisting the enemy\u2019s efforts of exploitation.\\na. I am an American, fighting in the forces which guard\\nmy country and our way of life. I am prepared to give my life\\nin their defense.\\n186TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nb.

I will accept neither parole nor special favors\\nfrom the enemy.\\nd. If I become a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my\\nfellow prisoners. I will give no information or take part in any\\naction which might be harmful to my comrades. If I am\\nsenior, I will take command. If not, I will obey the lawful\\norders of those appointed over me and will back them up in\\nevery way.\\ne. When questioned, should I become a prisoner of war,\\nI am required to give name, rank, service number, and date\\nof birth. I will evade answering further questions to the\\nutmost of my ability.

It denies the adversary\\nCRITICAL and SENSITIVE information about you, your\\norganization, and missions that if observed by your\\nadversary, can be used against us. You might ask: \u201cIf it\u2019s\\ncritical, wouldn\u2019t it be classified or something?\u201d OPSEC\\n187TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nprotects sensitive and/or critical information from adversary\\nobservation and collection in ways that traditional security\\nprograms cannot. While these programs, such as\\nInformation Assurance (IA), protect classified information,\\nthey cannot prevent all indicators of critical information,\\nespecially unclassified indicators, from being revealed. In\\nconcise terms, the OPSEC process identifies the critical\\ninformation of military plans, operations, and supporting\\nactivities, and the indicators that can reveal it, and develops\\nmeasures to eliminate, reduce, or conceal those indicators.\\nSo, what is my critical information you may ask? First, check\\nwith your leadership, to learn what information your\\ncommander has deemed critical. It will be in your\\ncommander\u2019s Critical Information List, or CIL. It contains\\ninformation items that are vital to the unit\u2019s mission that if an\\nadversary obtains it, correctly analyzes it, and acts upon it;\\ncould prevent or seriously degrade our mission success.\\nWhat else is critical? A simple acronym to use is CALI\\n(Capabilities, Activities, Limitations, and Intentions). It also\\nincludes items marked as Controlled Unclassified\\nInformation (CUI), Personally Identifiable Information, and\\nsensitive medical information. It may also include credit card\\nnumbers, security codes, passwords, home security,\\nfinancial history, and vacation plans. Always ask yourself,\\n\u201cWhat would an adversary or bad guy do with the\\ninformation?\u201d\\nWho are the adversaries?\\nInsiders. Those with misguided or divided loyalties,\\ncareless or disgruntled employees.\\n188TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nForeign Intelligence services (spies), or allied nations\\nthat collect to gain advantages over the US.\\nTerrorists, criminals, hackers, scam artists, identity\\nthieves, and the list goes on.\\nHow do they get my information?\\nSocial Engineering. Phone calls, emails (phishing),\\nrequests for information about you or your organization.\\nIs that really your bank or another unit asking for your\\ninformation?\\nSurveillance. What is in your trash/recycle bins, public\\nweb pages (.mil and unit social media sites), in your\\nwork area, or in your unencrypted emails? What\\ndiscussions are you having in public?\\nPhishing. Socially engineered email might contain\\ninfected attachments and/or hyperlinks that lead to web\\nsites hosting malware.\\nPersonal Mobile Devices. Hackers are rapidly\\ndeveloping malicious applications and programs for new\\ntechnologies. Very little security is built-in or readily\\navailable on these devices.\\nSocial Media. What are you, your family, and fellow\\nemployees posting, texting, or placing on social media?\\nCan it be used to social engineer or extort you? Can\\nterrorists or criminals target you?

Soldier for Life Program\\nThe U.S. Army established the Soldier for Life initiative in\\n1997 and increased its focus in July 2012. The intent was to\\ninspire Soldiers to identify as Soldiers for Life, always\\nremain proud of their service to the Nation, and conduct\\nthemselves as honorable men and women throughout their\\nlives not only as Soldiers but as Civilians. When Soldiers\\nreturn to society as private citizens, they remain moral-\\nethical exemplars for their Families and communities. Every\\nveteran of honorable service and Army retiree is a Soldier\\nfor Life and continues to contribute to the well-being of the\\nUnited States of America. In 2012, the Army Transition\\nAssistance Program was renamed the Soldier for Life\\nProgram and redesigned to enhance employment\\npreparation and opportunities for Soldiers leaving the Army\\nafter honorable service. Along with the Army Career and\\nAlumni Program (ACAP), the enhanced Soldier for Life\\nprogram was established to maintain trust with our Army\\nFamily during and after service. This program is designed to\\nenable Soldiers, Retired Soldiers, Veterans, and Families to\\nleave military service \u201cCareer Ready\u201d, and connect to an\\nestablished network to find employment, education, and\\nhealth resources. It focuses on the current serving\\npopulation to instill the Soldier for Life mindset of service.\\nThe Soldier for Life - Transition Assistance Program\\npromotes lifelong learning, individual development, and\\ntransition-related requirements throughout a Soldier\u2019s\\nmilitary Career. This program combines employment and\\neducation workshops and seminars tailored to prepare and\\nconnect transitioning Soldiers to meaningful civilian\\nemployment and education opportunities.\\n198TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nSoldier for Life Centers are located on installations, posts,\\ncamps, and stations where Soldiers and Families can find\\nresources to assist them in making educated decisions and\\nsound plans during all phases of their military lives: in-\\nservice, and post transition.\\nThe Soldier\u2019s for Life goal is to \u201cStart Strong, Serve Strong,\\nand Continue Strong.\u201d\\nOnce a Soldier, Always a Soldier...a Soldier for Life!\\n199TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nThis page left intentionally blank.\\n200TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nAppendix A - References\\nUnless otherwise indicated, TRADOC publications and\\nforms are available on the TRADOC Administrative\\nPublications website, https://adminpubs.tradoc.army.mil/.\\nDA publications and forms are available on the Army\\nPublishing Directorate website, https://armypubs.army.mil/.\\nDOD issuances and forms are available on the Executive\\nServices Division website, https://www.esd.whs.mil/DD/.\\nSection I\\nRequired Publications\\nThis section contains no entries.\\nSection II\\nRelated Publications\\nALARACT 068/2022\\nFiscal Year 2023 Approved Clothing Bag List, Initial Clothing\\nAllowance, Clothing Replacement Allowance, and Cash\\nAllowance\\nArmy Regulation 40-501\\nStandards of Medical Fitness\\nArmy Regulation 600-4\\nRemission or Cancellation of Indebtedness\\nArmy Regulation 600-8-22\\nMilitary Awards\\n201TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nArmy Regulation 600-20\\nArmy Command Policy\\nArmy Regulation 600-25\\nSalutes, Honors, and Visits of Courtesy\\nArmy Regulation 670-1\\nWear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia\\nArmy Techniques Publication 7-22.01\\nHolistic Health and Fitness Testing\\nArmy Techniques Publication 7-22.02\\nHolistic Health and Fitness Drills and Exercises\\nDA Pamphlet 670-1\\nGuide to the Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and\\nInsignia\\nField Manual 7-22\\nHolistic Health and Fitness\\nSTP-21-1-SMCT\\nSoldier\u2019s Manual of Common Tasks Warrior Skills Level 1\\nTraining Circular 3-21.5\\nDrill and Ceremonies\\nUCMJ (Appendix 2 of the Manual for Courts martial)\\n(Available on the Joint Service Component website,\\n202TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nhttps://jsc.defense.gov/Military-Law/Current-Publications-\\nand-Updates/)\\nWarfighter Nutrition Guide, May 2022.

Managing personal finances\\nIt is your duty as a Soldier to fulfill all your financial\\nobligations and provide for your Family members. There are\\n209TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nseveral key components to achieve this task. Here are 5\\nways to get started:\\n\u2022 Set financial goals. Whether it\u2019s to get out of debt or\\nbuild wealth, start with a clearly defined goal.\\n\u2022 Plan for your paycheck with a budget to meet all\\nyour financial obligations.\\n\u2022 Protect against financial emergencies with adequate\\ninsurance, a proper estate plan, and emergency\\nsavings.\\n\u2022 Be responsible with Debt and Credit \u2026especially\\nwhen purchasing a vehicle.\\n\u2022 Save for retirement by contributing at least 5% of\\nyour pay to your TSP.\\nIf you need assistance, visit your installation\u2019s Soldier\\nsupport center for money management services.\\nSetting Financial Goals:\\nPromotions, bonuses, incentive pay, and other pay\\nincreases are likely to happen throughout your Army career.\\nTo make the most of these financial opportunities, it\u2019s a\\ngood idea to write out clearly defined financial goals.\\nExamples of these goals might be to get out of debt,\\nestablish an emergency fund, invest towards retirement, or\\nsave for a major purchase. Financial goals provide you\\nguidance on how to best utilize your money and make smart\\nfinancial decisions.\\nSoldiers can log into the online pay system, MyPay, at\\nhttps://mypay.dfas.mil/ to review and print their leave and\\nearnings statement, thrift savings plan investments, savings\\n210TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\ndeposit program Statement, allotments, savings bond\\npurchases, and direct deposit amounts. Ensure you visit the\\nofficial military website only.\\nSure-Pay program: The Army requires all Soldiers to enroll\\nin the Sure-Pay program. This means that your paycheck is\\ndeposited directly to a checking or savings account. If you\\nclose or change this account, you must ensure that you go\\nto MyPay and update the account information.\\nThe Army will pay you twice per month on the 1st and the\\n15th.\\nYou must carefully review your monthly leave and earning\\nstatement to ensure that your pay is being deposited\\nproperly and you are receiving all the benefits (Base Pay,\\nBasic Allowance for Housing (BAH), etc.) that you are\\nentitled.\\nBank deposit account: There are some key items to\\nconsider when choosing your financial institution.\\nFirst, inquire if there is a monthly service charge for\\nmaintaining a checking account. Numerous institutions offer\\nfree checking if you set up Sure-Pay (direct deposit).\\nThe Army requires frequent moves so find an institution that\\ncan accommodate your mobile lifestyle.\\nNext, create a plan for every dollar for every paycheck. Build\\na budget and track all cash inflows and outflows. Remember\\nto allocate some for savings and some for investing.\\nFinally, it\u2019s recommended to establish a separate savings\\naccount for emergencies. For example, start with a small\\n211TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\ngoal, like a $1,000 balance, then save towards 3-6 months\\nof living expenses.\\nService Members Civil Relief Act (SCRA): The SCRA offers\\nmany benefits and protections to Soldiers and their\\nFamilies. It allows a service member to postpone or\\nsuspend certain civil actions while mobilized or deployed for\\nactive duty, including evictions, mortgage foreclosures,\\nbankruptcies, and other civil lawsuits. It covers all military\\nservice members from the date they enter active duty\\nthrough 30 to 90 days after active-duty discharge. The\\nSCRA also offers protection against high interest rate debt\\nsecured prior to entry into Active Duty; capping interest\\nrates on qualifying debt at 6%. Ensure you call all debtors\\n(credit cards, car loans, personal loans, etc.) as soon as\\npossible and notify them of your service, and that the SCRA\\nshould apply to your debt.\\nFailure to comply can result in legal action.\\nMilitary Lending Act: The Military Lending Act limits the\\nannual percentage rate for credit to no more than 36 percent\\nand includes associated costs of the loan, like fees and the\\nsale of credit products sold with the loan. This rate is known\\nas the military annual percentage rate, or MAPR.\\nAdditionally, the Military Lending Act prohibits mandatory\\narbitration, difficult contract provisions, using an allotment to\\nsecure the loan, waiving Servicemembers Civil Relief Act\\nrights, charging a penalty for early payments, using a post-\\ndated check to secure a loan, refinancing certain loans and\\nthe use of bank accounts and car titles to secure certain\\nother loans. Current protections cover payday, vehicle title\\nand tax refund anticipation loans. Purchases made through\\n212TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nrent-to-own and overdrafts on checking accounts are not\\ncovered.\\nLastly, while a local bank may be your best option, you may\\nopt to change accounts when you make a permanent\\nchange of station move.\\nCheck writing: You must pay close attention to each\\ntransaction to ensure you always know your checking\\naccount balance; this ensures you have sufficient funds in\\nthe account and do not write a fraudulent check.\\nManaging debt and maintaining good credit are important to\\nyour Army career. Establish a good credit reputation by\\npaying back debts on time, every time, and avoid carrying\\ndebt whenever possible.\\nBe thoughtful when making a major purchase, especially\\nwhen buying a vehicle. Carefully weigh the impact of a\\npurchase to your current and future situation.\\nThere are several consequences for writing a bad check,\\nservice charges, negative credit ratings, and additional\\npunishments if the check was used on post.\\nRetirement - Thrift Savings Plan (TSP): Although retirement\\nmay seem a long way off, the sooner you start saving the\\nbetter off you will be.\\nA delay of only 5 years in starting contributions could mean\\nseveral hundred thousand dollars later!\\nThe Army\u2019s retirement contribution system is the Thrift\\nSavings Plan (TSP). TSP contributions can be started online\\nat MyPay, then managed at https://www.tsp.gov/. In most\\ncases for new Soldiers the ROTH option (paying taxes\\n213TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nupfront but no taxes on interest when the money is\\nwithdrawn) is better, but it is important to research all\\noptions and talk to the financial planner at your Soldier\\nSupport Center.\\nMilitary One Source:\\nMilitary OneSource,\\nhttp://www.militaryonesource.mil/financial-and-legal and\\nmany other resources are available online to help you\\ndetermine how much to save, and how much money will be\\nneeded in retirement.\\nThe DOD Blended Retirement System (BRS) information\\nThe new retirement system is known as the \"Blended\\nRetirement System\" or BRS. The \u201cblending\u201d in BRS comes\\nfrom the blending of two major sources of retirement\\nincome: the existing annuity provision for those who retire\\nafter 20 or more years of service, PLUS the Thrift Savings\\nPlan (TSP). The TSP is a government-run 401(k) retirement\\naccount that allows members to invest their own money in\\neither stocks or government securities and get a contribution\\nto that account from their employer. Detailed information\\nand tools on the BRS are published on the DOD Military\\nCompensation website,\\nhttps://militarypay.defense.gov/BlendedRetirement/.\\nBRS uses the annuity formula currently in place: for those\\nstaying in the service 20 or more years, the average of the\\nservice member\\'s highest 36 months of basic pay would be\\nmultiplied by 2% times the number of years of service\\nThe best part of having a TSP contribution really applies to\\nthose who don\\'t stay in the military long enough to get a\\n214TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nretirement check. The government says that 83% of people\\nwho join the military don\\'t stay long enough to retire, so\\nwhen they leave after 5 or 10 years of military service they\\nbasically get nothing towards their future retirement. This\\nplan changes this situation. By contributing to the TSP,\\nmilitary members can leave the service at any time and\\nhave an existing retirement fund they can take with them\\nanywhere. Even if you decide to leave the military before\\ncompleting 20 years you keep the money in the TSP fund.\\nThe new system is made up of 3 specific components:\\n1. Defined Benefit:\\nRetired pay will be 2% times the number of years of\\nservice. If you retire at 20 years of service, you get 40%\\nof your final base pay. If you retire at 30 years of\\nservice, you get 60% of your \u2018high-three\u2019 base pay.\\nYou can either get your full retirement when eligible or\\nopt to get a lump-sum benefit at retirement. If you take\\nthe lump-sum you will get a reduced monthly retirement\\ncheck until age 67.\\n2. Defined Contribution:\\nThe military will contribute 1% of your base pay to\\nyour TSP.\\nYou will be automatically enrolled with a 3% base pay\\ncontribution to your TSP. (You can change this at any\\ntime.)\\nThe military will match up to 5% of your\\ncontribution after 2 years of service.\\n215TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nYou can always stop contributing to the TSP, get a loan\\nof your TSP balance, or withdraw your money from the\\nTSP account.\\n3. Continuation Pay: After you reach 12 years of active\\nservice and commit to 4 additional years of active\\nservice, you are eligible for a cash incentive of 2.5 to 13\\ntimes your regular monthly basic pay. This changes to\\n0.5 to 6 times your monthly basic pay if you are in the\\nreserves.\\nThe Department of Defense has several resources that\\nexplain the BRS on their Military Compensation website, to\\ninclude a BRS calculator. Members will receive BRS training\\nat their units.\\n216TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nFigure B-2. Retirement system\\n217TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nB-3. Tri-Service Health Care (TRICARE)\\nThe Army is dedicated to taking care of its most important\\nassets: Soldiers, and military Family members.\\nTRICARE is the Department of Defense\\'s worldwide health\\ncare program available to eligible beneficiaries from the\\nuniformed services.\\nTRICARE is free to Soldiers but may involve some out- of-\\npocket expenses for Family members. The cost varies\\ndepending on the Soldier\\'s rank and the specific TRICARE\\nprogram option in which the Family member is enrolled.\\nThrough the TRICARE program, Family members can also\\ngo to civilian health care providers if they desire. But before\\ngoing to a civilian practitioner, Family members should talk\\nto the beneficiary counseling and assistance coordinator at\\nthe nearest military health care facility to see if there are any\\nout-of-pocket expenses. The beneficiary counseling and\\nassistance coordinator will confirm your registration in the\\nDefense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS)\\nand can provide a list of doctors in your local area who will\\naccept TRICARE patients. Family members covered by\\nTRICARE can receive emergency care at any emergency\\nroom.

Servicemembers\u2019 Group Life Insurance (SGLI)\\nAs a United States Soldier, you may encounter hostile\\nsituations while stationed abroad and in combat. The well-\\nbeing of your Family is of the greatest concern to the Army.\\nOne of the many benefits afforded Soldiers is the\\nopportunity to purchase very low-cost life insurance. SGLI\\nprovides up to a maximum of $400,000. SGLI automatically\\ncovers you for this maximum amount unless you select, in\\nwriting a lesser amount, in increments of $50,000. You may\\nalso decline SGLI altogether, but this decision is so\\nimportant that you must also do that in writing. The payment\\nis deducted automatically from your pay each month.\\nSoldiers with Families almost always select coverage in the\\nmaximum amount.\\nSpouses and children are eligible for Family SGLI.\\nCoverage for a spouse is automatically $100,000 unless a\\nlesser amount, in steps of $10,000, is chosen.\\nVisit the Servicemember\u2019s Life Insurance page on the\\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs website at\\nhttps://www.benefits.va.gov/insurance/index.asp for\\nadditional information and assistance with enrollment.\\nB-5. Dental\\nThe level of dental care will vary from post to post, but it is\\navailable for all Soldiers. Family member care is generally\\nnot available at military dental facilities, but many locations\\nnow offer civilian dental practices on military installations.\\n219TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nFamily members may receive dental insurance through the\\nTRICARE Dental Program (TDP). The TDP is dental\\ninsurance in which you pay a monthly fee in exchange for\\nFamily coverage. It is a voluntary, cost effective,\\ncomprehensive program offered worldwide by the\\nDepartment of Defense to Family members of all active-duty\\nbranches of the military, Selected Reserve, and Individual\\nReady Reserve members.\\nFamily members must be registered in DEERS to be eligible\\nfor the TRICARE Dental Program.\\nTo participate, the Soldier must have 12 months remaining\\non their service commitment at the time of enrollment and\\nsubmit an enrollment form with the first month\\'s premium or\\nenroll online using a charge card. The monthly premiums\\nwill typically be deducted from the Soldier\\'s pay, although\\nthere are other payment options.\\nDepending on the dental procedures performed, treatment\\nmay be completely covered by the insurance, or there may\\nbe co-payments.\\nThere is a maximum annual amount that TRICARE will pay\\nfor any one beneficiary. Once that yearly amount is reached\\nfor the individual, all costs above the maximum must be paid\\nby the Family.\\nWhen permitted, complete information and instructions on\\nhow to enroll and find a local dental provider are available\\non-line at the TRICARE Dental site,\\nhttp://www.tricare.mil/CoveredServices/Dental.aspx.\\n220TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nB-6.

Soldier for Life and credentialing\\nIf you serve faithfully and honorably, whether in the active or\\nreserve components, or serve for one enlistment or a long\\ncareer, you will be a Soldier for Life.\\n223TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nThe Army wants to be a partner in your lifelong success, to\\ninclude the successful transition to civilian life and civilian\\nemployment.\\nIt\u2019s never too early to start thinking about your long-term\\ngoals and taking steps, even small ones, to achieve them.\\nWhile in the Army, you will learn valuable skills. Strive to be\\nthe best in your specialty.\\nVeterans sometimes have trouble explaining their military\\nexperience in terms that are meaningful to civilian\\nemployers, in turn making it difficult to find a job.\\nOne of the best ways to strengthen your resume is by\\nearning a credential. A credential is a government-issued\\nlicense (usually from state governments) or a certificate\\nfrom a non-government credentialing agency, which shows\\nthat person is qualified to perform a particular job or activity.\\nCommercial truck driver\u2019s licenses and medical licenses are\\nexamples of government-issued credentials.\\nNon-government credentialing agencies that offer\\ncertifications include the National Institute for Automotive\\nService Excellence, the American Culinary Federation, and\\nthe American Welding Society.\\nTo learn about credentials related to your MOS, visit the\\nArmy Credentialing Opportunities On-line (COOL) website\\nat https://www.cool.osd.mil/army/index.html (or search your\\nweb browser for \u201cArmy COOL\u201d). You will learn more about\\ncredentialing in your military training and from the leaders in\\nyour unit of assignment.\\n224TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nThe Army Credentialing Program (ACP)\\nThe ACP enables Soldiers to capitalize on training and\\ndevelopment opportunities throughout their military careers\\nso that they can grow and develop as a Soldier. The three\\nvoluntary programs in the ACP portfolio are:\\n1. The United Services Military Apprenticeship Program\\n(USMAP)\\nWhile actively serving, you have the chance to enhance\\nyour job skills and accomplish civilian apprenticeship\\nrequirements through formal training. A dynamic blend\\nof hands-on experience and relevant technical\\ninstruction, resulting in credentials being recognized by\\nindustries far and wide. These credentials, coupled with\\nDepartment of Labor certification as a journey worker,\\nopen doors to remarkable career advancement.\\n2. Institutionally Delivered Credentialing (IDC)\\nIDCs aren\\'t just certifications, they\\'re pathways to\\nexpertise in your specific Military Occupational\\nSpecialties, Areas of Concentration, and courses.\\nGaining specialized skills that set you apart.\\nThese credentials can be accessed while attending\\nArmy Training Centers, NCO Academies, and\\nprofessional military education schools. Funding covers\\na comprehensive range, from course fees to licensing\\nexams and study materials to expert guidance. Contact\\nyour Schoolhouse point of contact before attending any\\nprofessional military education for IDC opportunities.\\n225TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n3. Credentialing Assistance Program (CA)\\nThe Army CA Program is your invitation to propel your\\nfuture \u2013 both during your military service and beyond.\\nChoose courses and exams that resonate with your\\ncareer aspirations. Whether you\\'re looking to elevate\\nyour skills within your current MOS or aiming for a new\\noccupational horizon that is not aligned to your MOS,\\npost-military service.

When you attend an Army School, you might be\\nasked to volunteer to take a credentialing exam. The Army\\nmight give you study material, including web-based training.\\nThey might pay your fees and decide for you to take the\\nexam. We encourage you to take advantage of these\\nprograms, take them seriously, and study.\\nYou could earn a valuable credential that will someday\\nmake your job application stand out.\\nThe Army believes that studying for a\\ncredential in your field makes you a more\\nwell-rounded Soldier, and it is one sign that\\nyou are a true professional in your military\\nspecialty.\\nThere is so much variety among military specialties,\\ncredentials, and credentialing agencies.\\nSome military specialties (for example, Motor Transport\\nOperators, Wheeled Vehicle Mechanics, Food Service\\nSpecialists, and many others) closely match civilian jobs.\\nOther valuable military specialties, such as Infantrymen and\\nArmor Crew Members, do not match civilian jobs.\\nIf you are in a specialty that does not closely match a civilian\\njob and does not have a lot of credentialing opportunities,\\nthere are several things you can do.\\nSome of these are good ideas for all Soldiers:\\n227TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\n\u2022 In the words of the Chief of Staff of the Army, the\\nbest credential is often a college degree. When you\\nfinish your Initial Military Training, talk the Career\\nCounselor in your unit and to an Education\\nCounselor, they can advise you about continuing\\nyour education.\\n\u2022 Remember that you are still learning life skills that\\nwill be valuable to an employer. Army Veterans tend\\nto be reliable, hard-working, goal-oriented, \u201cteam\\nplayers\u201d and drug-free. As a future Non-\\nCommissioned Officer (sergeant), you will learn\\nleadership, effective communication, how to train\\nothers, and how to supervise a job site.\\n\u2022 Even if your \u201cmain job\u201d doesn\u2019t match a civilian job,\\ntake advantage of any opportunities that come your\\nway to learn new skills, for example, computer skills\\nand operating and maintaining different types of\\nequipment.\\n\u2022 Keep checking! The Army is developing new\\ncredentialing opportunities.\\nTips and Precautions: One of the reasons that some\\ncredentials are so valuable is that they are hard to get. If\\nyou sign up for a credentialing exam, study!\\n\u2022 If you did your best, don\u2019t be discouraged if you\\ndon\u2019t pass on the first try. Remember everything you\\nlearned by studying to take the exam and consider\\ntrying again.\\n\u2022 If you choose a credential to work on, be sure that\\nthe credential is the right one for you. Before you\\n228TRADOC Pamphlet 600-4\\nspend your money or use up some of your military\\nbenefits, make sure that the credential is offered by\\na reputable agency and is known and valued by\\nemployers.\\n\u2022 Many credentials have re-certification requirements\\nor continuing education requirements.

The U.S. Army\u2019s\\nasymmetric advantage in this volatile and complex world is our leadership at echelon. No other Army in the world\\ncan match us; frankly speaking, we have the best people.\\nI firmly believe that leaders are made and not born, and thus require a significant investment of time and energy\\nto develop. FM 6-22 assists in this quest and applies to all leaders at echelon, from fire team to division.It provides\\nspecifics and examples of how to develop leaders, including oneself. This doctrine walks through a range of\\ndevelopmental activities that focus on feedback, practice, and study.\\nThis manual tells the reader how an Army leader looks and acts.

The title change reflects the manual\u2019s\\nemphasis on developing leaders at the direct and organizational levels. FM 6-22 emphasizes the active process of\\nteaching, training, coaching, mentoring, study, and learning required for developing Army leaders. Development\\ndoes not merely happen because of established institutional and administrative policies; developing leaders\\nrequires deliberate intent and genuine engagement by raters, senior raters, instructors, trainers, support personnel,\\nand the leaders themselves.\\nLeadership is fundamental to Army operations as an element of combat power; subsequently developing leaders\\nrequires an understanding of related doctrine. To comprehend FM 6-22, readers should be familiar with the\\nfundamentals of leadership, attributes, and competencies in ADP 6-22, Army Leadership and the Profession;\\nunderstand the nature and fundamentals of operations as described in ADP 3-0, Operations; and be able to\\nexercise command and control as described in ADP 6-0, Mission Command: Command and Control of Army\\nForces. The leader attributes and competencies are common to all Army leaders. Each branch identifies the\\ntechnical and tactical knowledge, skills and abilities required of leaders to perform their duties at specific grades\\nand positions. As the operations process is the framework for exercising command and control,readers must also\\nunderstand the fundamentals of the operations process established in ADP 5-0, The Operations Process.\\nThe principal audience for FM 6-22 is all Army leaders, military and civilian. FM 6-22 serves as a primary aid to\\nleaders to develop individuals and cohesive teams from the division down with a focus on company to brigade\\nlevels. Trainers and educators throughout the Army use this manual.\\nCommanders, staffs, and subordinates must ensure that their decisions and actions comply with applicable U.S.,\\ninternational, and in some cases host-nation laws and regulations. Commanders at all levels will ensure that their\\nSoldiers operate in accordance with the law of armed conflict (LOAC) and applicable rules of engagement.

Developing leaders is a complex and complicated undertaking because it is primarily\\na human endeavor\u2014requiring constant involvement, assessment, and refinement. Today\u2019s Army demands trained\\nand ready units with agile, proficient leaders. Developing our leaders and ourselves is integral to our institutional\\nsuccess today and tomorrow. It is an important investment for the Army\u2019s future because it builds trust in\\nrelationships and units, prepares leaders for future uncertainty, and is critical to readiness and our Army\u2019s success.\\nLeader development programs must recognize, produce, and reward leaders who are inquisitive, creative,\\nadaptable, and able to exercise mission command. Leaders exhibit commitment to developing subordinates\\nthrough executing their professional responsibility to teach, counsel, coach, and mentor subordinates. Successful\\nprograms that develop leaders incorporate accountability, engagement, and commitment; create agile and\\ncompetent leaders; produce stronger teams and organizations; and increase expertise.\\nDeveloping leaders involves many practices to ensure people have opportunities to fulfill their goals and the Army\\nhas capable leaders in position and ready for the future. Practices include recruiting, accessions, training\\n(including coaching, teaching, mentoring, fostering and advocating self-development), education, assigning,\\npromoting, broadening, and retaining the best leaders, while challenging them over time with greater\\nresponsibility, authority, and accountability. Army leaders assume progressively broader responsibilities across\\ndirect, organizational, and strategic leadership levels.\\nFM 6-22 integrates doctrine, experience, and best practices by drawing upon applicable Army doctrine and\\nregulations; input of effective Army officers, warrant officers, noncommissioned officers, and Department of the\\nArmy (DA) Civilians; recent Army leadership studies; and research on effective practices from the private and\\npublic sectors. This manual is about how to develop leaders to become skilled leaders. The Army\u2019s broader family\\nof field manuals develops leaders\u2019 technical and tactical expertise. Branches identify the technical and tactical\\nknowledge and skills for specific grades and positions.\\nTalent management and leader development are linked but separate processes. The Army develops individuals to\\nbe effective leaders. Talent management is an administrative process that puts the right person in the right job.\\nArmy leaders develop themselves and others by:\\n(cid:122) Planning, prioritizing, and engaging in developmenteven when resources are limited.\\n(cid:122) Gaining self-awareness thru feedback gained from performance counseling and assessments.\\n(cid:122) Integrating development into day-to-day activities.\\n(cid:122) Taking advantage of opportunities to provide constructive feedback.\\n(cid:122) Strengthening leader attributes and competencies during developmental activities.\\nThis manual is not intended to be read in a single sitting, although it is laid out in a fashion where that is possible.\\nThe information in this manual is best read and absorbed one chapter at a time, with time for reflection and\\ndigestion in between readings. FM 6-22 contains five chapters that describe the Army\u2019s doctrine covering how to\\ndevelop leaders:\\nChapter 1 discusses the Army\u2019s tenets for developing leaders, leader development challenges, leadership\\nrequirements, building teams, and development transitions across organizational levels.\\nChapter 2 addresses the fundamentals for developing leaders in units by setting conditions, providing feedback,\\nand enhancing learning while creating opportunities.\\nChapter 3 provides information on the individual\u2019s self-development process starting with identification of\\nstrengths and developmental needs, setting goals, and creating individual development plans.\\nChapter 4 provides recommended learning and developmental activities for the attributes and competencies.\\nChapter 5 discusses creating unit programs to develop teams of leaders and assessing unit programs.\\nThe References section includes pertinent links to recommended websites and developmental readings.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 ixIntroduction\\nIntroductory Figure 1.

There is no more important task for the U.S. Army than developing its people to lead others to defeat\\nany enemy, anywhere. Developing leaders is inherently part of every garrison activity, training event, and\\nreal-world operation Army forces conduct around the world. Each leader\u2013subordinate interaction is a\\ndevelopment opportunity. They are inseparable from training, enforcing standards, providing feedback, and\\nsetting a personal example.\\n1-2. Effective leaders represent the U.S. Army\u2019s strategic advantage over its adversaries, and developing\\nleaders ensures the Army maintains that advantage. The Army develops adaptable leaders capable of\\naccomplishing missions in dynamic, unstable, and complex environments. A robust, holistic, and purposeful\\nleader development program at strategic, organizational, and direct levels is essential to readiness and future\\nsuccess. The Army develops leaders who are agile, adaptive, and innovative through a mix of education,\\ntraining, and experience. This encourages a leader who acts with boldness and initiative to execute missions\\naccording to doctrine and orders. The goal is to develop Army leaders who clearly provide purpose, direction,\\nmotivation, and vision to their teams and subordinates while executing missions to support their\\ncommander\u2019s intent.\\n1-3. Developing leaders is fundamental to our Army. Leader developmentis the deliberate, continuous, and\\nprogressive process\u2014founded in the Army Values\u2014that develops Soldiers and Army Civilians into\\ncompetent, committed professional leaders of character. Leaders develop through career-long synthesis of\\nthe training, education, and experiences acquired through opportunities in the institutional, operational, and\\nself-development domains. Developing leaders includes all cohorts and components, beginning at\\nrecruitment and continuing until the leader leaves service (AR 350-1). A key component of leader\\ndevelopment is remaining focused on the professionalism of our leaders and those they lead. By developing\\nand promoting a professional force, the Army develops trust on several levels: between Soldiers; between\\nSoldiers and leaders; between Soldiers and Department of the Army (DA) Civilians; between Soldier families\\nand the Army; between the Army and Government; and between the Army and the American people. This is\\nwhy the Army commits to providing quality education institutions and training along with challenging\\nexperiences and opportunities throughout a career to develop effective leaders and ready units.\\n1-4. Setting the proper development expectations of subordinates is critical, so they understand their\\ndevelopment is a continuous process encompassing almost everything they do regardless of context.\\nSignificant leader development occurs during professional education, unit leader development programs, and\\ncounseling sessions. However, Army research shows the most effective developmental experiences occur in\\nthe operational domain, during daily interactions with subordinates as they prepare for and execute missions.\\nThese interactions create enduring positive results and prepare subordinates for greater levels of\\nresponsibility when they integrate with daily operations and allow for shared understanding about standards,\\ndesired outcomes, and lessons learned.\\n1-5. Developing leaders and being developedby others requires mutual understanding between leaders and\\nsubordinates\u2014both about the work involved in developing others and work needed to become a good leader.\\nThe developmental experience can be challenging and requires openness and a willingness to take risks and\\nlearn from experiences (both successes and failures). Those who lead and develop other leaders must treat\\nexperiences as lessons learned sources.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 1-1Chapter 1\\nLeader Development and Training Overlap\\nUnit or organizational culture that emphasizes developing leaders through training\\npriorities, sets expectations by grade and duty position, and develops leaders to\\nachieve those expectations, is a proven tactic for developing tactically-and technically-\\nsound subordinate leaders. Giving subordinate leaders opportunities to observe others\\noperating a rifle or gunnery range to standard then coaching them as they do likewise,\\nis an example of how training and leader development overlap in a practical sense.\\nThose subordinates are prepared to execute similar missions in their next unit while\\ndeveloping their subordinates for greater responsibility.\\nTENETS OF DEVELOPING LEADERS\\n1-6. Tenets of developing leaders are the essential principles that make the Army successful at developing\\nits leaders. The tenets provide a backdrop for the Army\u2019s unit training principles (see ADP 7 0). The\\noverarching tenets are\u2014\\n(cid:122) Strong commitment by the Army, superiors, and individuals to developing leaders.\\n(cid:122) Clear purpose and intention for what, when, and how to develop leadership.\\n(cid:122) Supportive relationships and culture of learning.\\n(cid:122) Three mutually supportive domains (institutional, operational, and self-development) that enable\\neducation, training, and experiences.\\n(cid:122) Providing, accepting, and acting on candid assessment and feedback for self-awareness.\\n1-7. The Army prioritizes developing its people beyond a directed responsibility to develop subordinates.\\nAR 600-100 directs Army leaders to develop their subordinates. Leaders must commit to developing others\\nand themselves; Members want to serve in an organization that values camaraderie and teamwork while\\nimproving others\u2019 capabilities. accountability for implementation follows responsibility.\\n1-8. Development occurs through both formal systems and informal practices. Reception and integration,\\nnewcomer training, developmental tasks and assignments, individual and collective training, educational\\nevents, transition or succession planning, and broadening are all activities where development occurs and\\nshould be encouraged. Development in the three mutually supportive domains (institutional, operational, and\\nself-development) involves experiential learning that is consistent with the principle of train as you fight.\\nAny experience that shapes and improves performance enhances development. Emphasizing any\\ndevelopmental domain at another\u2019s expense hinders learning.\\n1-9. Feedback is necessary to guide and gauge development. Formal and informal feedback based on\\nobservation and assessment provide information to confirm or increase self-awareness about developmental\\nprogress. The Army established performance monitoring, evaluation reports, coaching, growth counseling\\nprocesses, and self-awareness assessments to engage leaders and individuals. Feedback that goes from leader\\nto led is essential for learning along with other feedback sources to develop leaders. Forming a mentoring or\\ncoaching relationship outside unit lines is a means to obtain informal feedback. Another is the feedback\\nleaders obtain though self-assessments, study to improve, and application of knowledge orskills.\\n1-10. Development depends on having clear purpose for why, what, when and how to develop. Good leader\\ndevelopment is purposeful and goal oriented. A clearly established purpose enables leaders to guide, assess,\\nand accomplish development. The principlesfor developing leaders describe goals for what leaders need to\\nbe developed to do: lead by example, develop subordinates, create a positive environment for learning,\\nexercise mission command, adaptive performance, critical and creative thinking, and know subordinates and\\ntheir families. The core leader competencies and attributes identified in ADP 6-22 provide additional detail\\non what leaders need to be, know, and do.\\n1-11. Developing leaders includes holding subordinates accountable for maintaining Army standards,\\ndemonstrating the leadership requirements model competencies and attributes, adhering to Army Values, and\\naccomplishing missions. Leaders must consider each situation and select the best approach to hold\\nsubordinates accountable. Sometimes, a private verbal correction is adequate, in others, where time or safety\\n1-2 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Developing Leaders\\nare paramount, a public correction commensurate with the seriousness of the situation is warranted. In others,\\nwritten counseling provides a reference for future professional development. Setting expectations in a unit\\nabout how and why leaders hold subordinates accountable is itself a means of developing leaders. It ensures\\nshared understanding on effective leader requirements and unit standards, ultimately growing better leaders\\nand maintaining positive command climates.\\nLEADERSHIP REQUIREMENTS\\n1-12. The Nation and the Army articulate their expectations of Army leaders through the Army leadership\\nrequirements model (see figure 1-1) that illustrates expectations of every leader, whether military or civilian,\\nofficer or enlisted, active or reserve. It covers the core leader requirements and expectations of all leadership\\nlevels. Attributes are the desired internal leader characteristics\u2014what the Army wants leaders to be and\\nknow. Competencies are skillsand behaviors the Army expects leaders to acquire, demonstrate, and continue\\nto enhance\u2014what the Army wants leaders to do.\\n1-13. A clear leadership requirements framework provides leaders the basis to assess their strengths and\\ndevelopmental needs and to determine goals for improvement. The Army\u2019s leadership requirements model\\nspecifically provides leaders with enduring attributes and competencies. The model provides a consistent\\nreference point throughout professional and personal development progression.Leaders must improve in all\\nthe leader competencies, become more knowledgeable about the way the military operates, and understand\\nhow to operate in complex geopolitical situations.\\nFigure 1-1. Leadership requirements model (ADP 6-22)\\n1-14. As Army leaders develop themselves and others, they must guard against counterproductive leadership\\nbehaviors. The leadership requirements model identifies what leaders need to develop; counterproductive\\nleadership identifies where leaders may need correction as they develop. As future operational environments\\nwill be increasingly complex, it is imperative to identify and counteract anything that prevents mission\\nsuccess. Counterproductive leadership is the demonstration of leader behaviors that violate one or more of\\nthe Army\\'s core leader competencies or Army Values, preventing a climate conducive to mission\\naccomplishment (ADP 6-22). Counterproductive leadership has long-term negative effects on individuals\\nand units, impeding mission accomplishment and negating combat advantages.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 1-3Chapter 1\\n1-15. Counterproductive leadership tends to fall into several categories: abusive, self-serving, erratic,\\nleadership incompetence, and corrupt (see ADP 6-22 for complete descriptions). All leaders are susceptible\\nto counterproductive leadership, especially during stress, high operating tempo, or other chaotic conditions.\\nLeft uncorrected, the negative effects can quickly cascade, lowering morale, commitment, cohesion,\\nperformance, readiness, and mission accomplishment.\\n1-16. Counterproductive leadership is complex and must be handled in an effective and constructive way\\nthat does not lead to further problems. Table 1-1 provides questions to identify, assess, and address\\ncounterproductive leadership. Training modules are available on the CAPL website.\\nTable 1-1. Questions to focus approach dealing with counterproductive leadership\\nIdentify What is the behavior? What category does it fit in?\\nAssess What conditions and factors influence the behavior(s)? Define the situation, actors, behaviors, and\\nbehavior impact. Is there a pattern to the behaviors?\\nAddress What strategies (intervening for others, directly addressing, or strengthening resilience) should be\\nemployed to address or cope with the behavior?\\nDEVELOPING COHESIVE AND EFFECTIVE TEAMS\\n1-17. The Army relies on effective teams to perform tasks, achieve objectives, and accomplish missions.\\nBuilding and maintaining teams that operate effectively is essential. To do this, Army leaders employ Army\\nteam building, a continuous process of enabling a group of people to reach their goals and improve\\ntheir effectiveness through leadership and various exercises, activities, and techniques. Figure 1-2\\noutlines the Army team building process.\\nFigure 1-2. Army team building process model\\n1-18. Three qualities characterize good teamwork: climate, identity, and cohesion. Climate refers to how\\nmembers think and feel about their organization, based on shared perceptions and attitudes. It depends on the\\npersonalities within a unit, which change as people come and go. Team identity develops through a shared\\nunderstanding of what the team exists to do and what the team values. Cohesion is the unity or togetherness\\nacross team members and forms from mutual trust, cooperation, and confidence. Teamwork increases when\\nteams operate in a positive, engaging, and emotionally safe environment. An engaging environment occurs\\nwhere team members desire to work together on missions; they feel a sense of self-worth and accomplishment\\n1-4 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Developing Leaders\\nof something more important than they are. A safe environment occurs when team members feel they can be\\nopen and not threatened by unwarranted criticism.\\n1-19. Teamwork fosters open communication, improves professional relations, contributes to unit\\nmotivation, and builds trust. Teamwork pulls together a diverse groups\u2019 knowledge and experience to\\naccomplish the mission. Knowing the elements of effective teams and developing teamwork assists leaders\\nto assemble the team, orient them, create an identity, cultivate trust, engage in solving problems, manage\\nprocesses, regulate team dynamics, and deliver results to other organizations and stakeholders. High\\nperforming teams enforce high standards and hold each other accountable for their actions including their\\nperformance or output level. Table 1-2 compares effective and ineffective teams\u2019 characteristics. See ATP\\n6-22.6 for specific techniques.\\nTable 1-2.

The Army develops officers, at all levels, to understand and practice the mission command principles\\nto lead and conduct military operations to support unified land operations. The Army expects officers to\\nintegrate developmental practices with collective and individual training to accomplish the Army\u2019s missions\\nand develop subordinatesfor future responsibilities. They routinely operate at direct-level interactions with\\nothers and work at the organizational and strategic levels to plan, prepare, execute, and assess policies,\\nsystems, and practices. Warrant officers serve at all echelonsas the primary specialized experts, integrators,\\nmanagers, and trainers who operate, maintain, administer, and supervise the Army\u2019s equipment, support\\nactivities, and technical systems and processes in accordance with their primary career field. They bring an\\nunequalled depth of knowledge, experience, leadership, and perspective to operations. Warrant officers, at\\nall echelons, understand and practice the mission command principles to execute unified land operations. See\\nDA PAM 600-3 for developmental opportunities throughout an officer\u2019s career.\\n1-21. NCOs are responsible for setting and maintaining high-quality standards and discipline while\\nconducting daily missions making decisions based on disciplined initiative derived from commanders\\' intent.\\nNCOs serve as standard-bearers and role models vital to training, educating, and developing subordinates.\\nThrough training, coaching, mentoring, counseling, and informal interaction, NCOs guide Soldier\\ndevelopment every day and play a role in developing junior officers. NCOs advise officers at all levels and\\nare an important source of knowledge, experience, and discipline for all enlisted matters. See DA PAM 600-\\n25 for professional development opportunities.\\n1-22. DA Civilians provide crucial continuity and leadership to complement Soldiers\u2019 roles. DA Civilian\\nleaders require a broad understanding of military, political, and business-related strategies, as well as\\nmanagerial, leadership, and decision-making skills. DA Civilians develop other DA Civilians and support\\nmilitary leader development as supervisors, mentors, and instructors. DA Civilians should understand and\\nexercise the mission command principles while providing mission-based capabilities to support Army\\nmissions. See Department of Defense (DOD) Instruction 1430.16 and AR 690-950 for specifics.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 1-5Chapter 1\\nLeader development by walking around\u2014the continual face-to-face engagement by leaders during\\ndaily duties\u2014is the most effective informal means of developing leaders at the platoon, company,\\nbattalion, and brigade level.\\nTRANSITIONS ACROSS ORGANIZATIONAL LEVELS\\n1-23. Continual learning and development are the cornerstone for creating and sustaining an agile Army.\\nThrough activities in the institutional, operational, and self-development domains, personnel obtain\\neducation, training, and experiences to grow and succeed at positions of greater responsibility. As Army\\nleaders progress in leadership responsibilities, it is necessary for them to develop new skills and abilities to\\nrefine how they will lead at the next level.\\n1-24. The timing of development is especially important because personnel join and move through a series\\nof alternating and progressive education, training, and operational experiences. The approach applies to DA\\nCivilians as well; however, federal service does not program advancement opportunities for most positions.\\nDA Civilians move across positions based on the governing regulations and laws relating to applying for and\\nfilling positions. Ideally, the best direct-level leaders are developed into organizational level leaders and\\nultimately into strategic and enterprise level leaders.\\n1-25. In addition to the leadership requirements model, leaders must grow in their ability to understand,\\nvisualize, describe, direct, lead, and assess under differing conditions changing at each leadership level. As\\nleaders progress, they experience greater challenges based on the situation\u2019s scope, the consequences and\\nrisks involved, and the time horizon. As scope increases, the number of people and outside parties involved\\nincreases. The consequences of decisions increase, as do the risks that leaders must address. The length of\\ntime that leaders\u2019 decisions apply tend to increase at higher levels as well as the time over which leaders can\\napply influence.\\n1-26. Career transitions can be difficult, regardless of performance and potential at prior levels. When\\nmoving into new roles with different demands, individuals may not perform at a previous high level.\\nIndividuals must have a developmental mindset to improve what is within their capability and be motivated\\nto do their best. Their leaders have a responsibility to develop the capability. The Army endorses a culture\\nwhere individuals continually strive to learn, broaden personal skills, and improve.\\n1-27. The required attributes and the expected competencies leaders perform do not change. However, some\\nattributes and skills become more important in certain positions based on leader level and responsibilities\\n(see transition descriptions). Proficiency levels regarding leader performance are specific to the individual\\nleader, not their age, rank, cohort, or assigned position. Leaders of all ability levels should take advantage of\\nopportunities to improve. The true nature of the Army leadership attributes and competencies is that there is\\nno ultimate quality level to reach. Regardless of their capability, leaders are always able to learn more\u2014\\nincreasing their adaptability, versatility, and effectiveness when influencing others and improving their\\norganizations.\\n1-28. For military leaders, six leadership levels span the full range of Army organizations. The changes\\nacross levels correspond to the growth of responsibility, increase in the number of personnel affected, and\\nthe stakes involved. Not all levels and transitions apply to all organizational cohorts, military fields, or\\nfunctions and some Army positions do not fit neatly into this transitions model. Similar transition points exist\\nfor DA Civilians, each requiring progressive responsibility levels. Personnel begin by managing themselves.\\nLeading and preparing self is constant through the entire process no matter where one enters and exits the\\nleadership continuum. Self-management and self-preparation are important steps in preparing for initial\\nleader responsibilities. Six transitions that may apply to leaders in Army organizations are\u2013\\n(cid:122) Leading at the direct level. Initial-entry Soldiers and DA Civilians transition from a focus on self\\nto providing direct leadership to others to accomplish missions. Junior leaders learn how to plan\\ndaily tasks and activities, understand organizational constructs, and interact with subordinates,\\npeers, and superiors.\\n(cid:122) Leading organizations. The second transition occurs with leaders at the organizational level. This\\nlevel begins at company, battery, troop, staff, and similar organization levels for DA Civilians.\\n1-6 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Developing Leaders\\nDirect level leadership still occurs at this level, but the leaders become leaders of leaders and rarely\\nperform individual tasks, unless they serve in undermanned organizations or an emergency.\\nCoaching subordinate, direct-line leaders and setting a positive example as a leader are two\\ncharacteristics that stand out at this level.\\n(cid:122) Leading functions. The third transition is from leading an organization (as a leader of direct-line\\nleaders) to leading functions. This level involves directing functions beyond a single individual\u2019s\\nexperience path. Key characteristics are operating with other leaders of leaders and adopting a\\nlonger-term perspective. Functional leaders typically include majors, mid-level warrant officers,\\nand mid-level NCOs.\\n(cid:122) Leading integration. A fourth transition occurs when leaders assume command and leadership\\nresponsibility for battalion and similar-sized generating force organizations. These leaders must\\nbecome more adept at establishing and communicating a vision and deciding on goals and mission\\noutcomes. They need to find time for reflection and analysis and value the importance of making\\ntrade-offs between future goals and current needs. Positive attitudes related to trust, accepting\\nadvice, and accepting feedback pays dividends at this level and into the future.\\n(cid:122) Leading large organizations. A fifth transition occurs at the brigade-equivalent and higher levels\\nof operational and institutional organizations. They often operate outside their experience paths\\nwhile leading others operating beyond theirs as well. Leaders will only be successful by valuing\\nothers\u2019 expertise and success. Humility is a desired characteristic of organizational and strategic\\nleaders who should recognize that others have specialized expertise indispensable to success. A\\nmodest view of one\\'s own importance underscores an essential element to foster cooperation\\nacross organizations. Even the humblest person needs to guard against an imperceptible ego\\ninflation when constantly exposed to high levels of attention and opportunities.\\n(cid:122) Leading the enterprise. A final step occurs in the transition to serving as an enterprise leader.\\nEnterprise leaders must be long-term, visionary thinkers who spend considerable time interacting\\nwith agencies beyond the military. This leader must be willing to relinquish control of enterprise\\nelements to strategic and junior-level leaders.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 1-7This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 2\\nFundamentals of Development\\n2-1.

Other sources provide guidance on techniques associated with the\\nformal activities, such as AR 623-3 on the evaluation process, AR 621-7 and DA PAM 600-3 on broadening\\nassignments, ATP 6-22.1 on the counseling process, and ATP 6-22.6 on team building.\\n2-2. Leadership requires establishing interpersonal relationships based on trust and setting the example for\\neveryone\u2013\u2013subordinates, peers, and superiors. In leader development surveys, leaders ranked leading a unit,\\npersonal examples, and mentoring as the three most effective ways to develop their leadership skills.\\nExperience is a powerful learning tool; however, learning from experience is not guaranteed. As the tenets\\nfor developing leaders convey, learning requires commitment and purpose. Learning occurs after reflecting\\non experiences. This chapter covers setting the conditions for development, gathering and providing\\nfeedback, reflection and study, and creating opportunities for continued experiential learning.\\n2-3. The following sections focus on the fundamentals of developing leaders (see figure 2-1):\\n(cid:122) Setting conditions for development.\\n(cid:122) Providing feedback on a leader\u2019s actions.\\n(cid:122) Enhancing learning through mentoring, training, reflection, and study.\\n(cid:122) Creating opportunities and evaluating effectiveness.\\nFigure 2-1.

Subtle actions on the leader\u2019s part build trust and communicate the role of trainer and developer.\\nExperienced leaders use several techniques to create a developmental culture:\\n(cid:122) A leader should be present to observe enough key activities without overwhelming subordinates.\\nAfter initial observations, give the observed leader time and space to exercise leadership without\\nbeing in the spotlight. This helps establish the leader\u2019s role as a supportive resource rather than an\\nevaluative note taker. It builds trust, self-confidence, and creativity in the follower.\\n(cid:122) As often as possible, leaders should employ an indirect approach. Start by providing observation\\ndescriptions along with positive and negative outcomes. Allow the subordinate to understand what\\nis going well and what needs improvement. The opposite of an indirect approach is to\\nmicromanage and be overly prescriptive, outlining specifics for completion.\\n(cid:122) Give each leader a fresh, objective start. Compare subordinates against objective standards. Avoid\\nsubjective comparisons to past leaders or units (including personal experiences). The bottom line\\nis to observe and assess each leader on individual merit. Avoid thinking of the observation process\\nas a means to grade leaders.\\nMistakes occur in all organizations and operational environments. Leaders foster a learning\\nenvironment by acknowledging that honest mistakes come with challenging missions. Tell leaders\\nabout a risky, challenging mission. Recount the mistakes made in trying to accomplish it. Wrap\\nup the discussion with the lessons learned from the experience.\\nLEARNING PRINCIPLES\\n2-8. Development is a change process. Applying learning principles throughout development accelerates\\nand improves learning. Table 2-2 presents principles to promote effective, efficient, and appealing learning.\\nTable 2-2. Learning principles\\nPrinciples How each principle works to encourage development\\nBeing task-or Learners are engaged in solving real-world problems. Real situations engage the learner\\nproblem-centered to thinkand act in ways that are relevant to future outcomes.\\nActivation Knowledge the learner already has serves as a foundation for new knowledge.\\nDemonstration New knowledge is demonstrated to the learner.\\nThe learner applies new knowledge. Repetition and practice across varying conditions\\nApplication enhances application\u2014interaction with role models and mentors, feedback and\\nreflection, and studying other leaders.\\nIntegration New knowledge is integrated into the learner\u2019s world.\\n2-9. These principles are compatible with and supportive of learning that occurs while completing duties,\\npractical exercises, or collective training. Opportunities that challenge the individual and encourage learning\\nenhance development. Learning best occurs when the interest area has real-world relevance, and the learner\\ncan synthesize new insights or create new knowledge.\\n2-10. Purposeful learning starts when learners are challenged to know more and do better. Purposeful\\nlearning occurs when practice at mastery of tasks and skills are integrated into leaders\u2019 day-to-day activities.\\nApplying the learning principles results in leaders who actively engage in learning, quickly retain and recall\\ninformation, and transfer learning to novel situations.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-3Chapter 2\\nIncorporating Developmental Opportunities\\nWhen assessing her company\u2019s performance from the previous week during the\\nbattalion training meeting, CPT Williams asserts that Alpha Company\u2019s squad\\ncohesion is not where it needs to be for the company to advance to platoon collective\\ntraining. Clearly frustrated, CPT Williams suggests to the battalion commander, LTC\\nCano, that last quarter\u2019s red cycle tasks and summer transitions prevented leaders\\nfrom developing their Soldiers, teams, and squads. Her first sergeant and fellow\\ncommand teams nod their heads in agreement.\\nLTC Cano: \u201cI understand your frustration, but we cannot allow high operating tempo\\nand Soldier turnover to interfere with our principal obligation as leaders: developing\\nour subordinates. Installation taskings, reception, and farewelling departing teammates\\nare all developmental opportunities and activities that should enhance cohesion.\u201d\\nCSM Baker: \u201cThat\u2019s true sir, but I\u2019m not sure our battalion unit training plan adequately\\nreflects the deliberate and continuous process that is fundamental to developing\\nleaders. The current plan implies leader development is just something we do in a\\nclassroom once per quarter.\u201d\\nLTC Cano: \u201cFair assessment sergeant major. MAJ Blank, you and I will review the\\nbattalion training plan this week. I want to ensure each event includes leader\\ndevelopment objectives linked to the Army\u2019s leadership requirements model.\u201d\\nGAINING KNOWLEDGE OF SUBORDINATES\\n2-11. For effective leader development, individual relationships with each subordinate are necessary.\\nLeaders who routinely interact with subordinates understand their subordinates\u2019 backgrounds and\\nexperiences better. This enables discovery of special skills and experiences to support specific missions.\\nGetting to know subordinates communicates a genuine interest in them as individuals, builds confidence, and\\ngenerates trust. Trust is key to having candid talks with leaders about their developmental needs.\\nTEAM TRUST ANDUNIT COHESION\\n2-12. Creating a positive climate that encourages learning contributes to all development aspects.\\nSubordinates have to be receptive, engaged, and ready to develop. Leaders should be aware of subordinate\u2019s\\nindividual needs when building rapport and offering feedback. Some individuals will need more; some will\\nneed less. Some individuals seek additional attention and feedback while some will want less.\\n2-13. The objective of engaging with subordinates is to listen to their responses and understand their\\nsituation. Build rapport by sharing something about yourself. Early in interactions withsubordinates, briefly\\nshare personal experiences\u2014including areas of specialized expertise and areas of less experience.\\n2-14. In certain circumstances, using social media to observe and share ideas may be beneficial. Accepting\\nan invitation to connect with a subordinate or allow a subordinate to follow your social media requires\\nforethought. Social media platforms allow subordinates to observe how leaders align their words and deeds\\nand allow leaders to observe and engage with subordinates about life events during and after service.\\n2-4 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Fundamentals of Development\\nSharing Experiences\\nLearning from others\u2019 experiences can be invaluable.

Counseling and feedback provide clear, timely, and accurate information concerning individual\\nperformance compared to established standards. During professional growth counseling and feedback\\nsessions, leaders should help subordinates identify individual strengths and developmental needs to design\\nan individual development plan (IDP), a tool primarily used by the individual subordinate to document short-\\nand long-term goals for career and personal development. All individuals are responsible for developing and\\nmaintaining their IDP. Leaders gain better understanding of their subordinates by helping them refine their\\nIDP for an individualized approach to professional development. Likewise, individuals and leaders should\\nunderstand that preparing an IDP does not solve all development issues\u2014the form only documents and guides\\nthe necessary actions to reach the specified goals while employing strengths and addressing needs. Reserve\\nComponent IDPs should include career development goals that balance Army careers with civilian careers.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-5Chapter 2\\nIntegrating Individual Development Plans\\nCOL Jones and CSM Hart are conducting their daily closeout meeting after the brigade\\nmission analysis brief for an upcoming combined arms live fire exercise.\\nCOL Jones: \u201cSergeant major, I\u2019ve noticed a trend during our brigade train up that\\nsuggests our leaders at echelon are having trouble anticipating risks and opportunities\\nin our large-scale combat operation training scenarios.\u201d\\nCSM Hart: \u201cThat is interesting sir. Where are these trends coming from?\u201d\\nCOL Jones: \u201cI had our battalion commanders analyze their subordinates\u2019 IDPs to help\\nus identify our strengths and weaknesses. They briefed their analysis during the latest\\ntraining brief. Our leaders self-identified mental agility as an attribute they considered\\na developmental need. Also, you and I have observed that our leaders need more\\ntraining reps to teach them what future tasks and resources to anticipate in combat.\u201d\\nCSM Hart: \u201cWell sir, if we identify these needs early in exercise planning it will give us\\nsome options. We could conduct a formal professional development session for the\\nbrigade, but I doubt we have the space available in the unit training plan to adequately\\naddress these dynamic developmental needs. Another option is to be deliberate with\\nexercise planning to incorporate these specific developmental needs as part of your\\ntraining objectives.\u201d\\nCOL Jones: \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea sergeant major. Let\u2019s meet with MAJ Price tomorrow\\nto brainstorm some ways to induce critical thinking to our leaders during training.\u201d\\nCOL Jones and CSM Hart met with MAJ Price to adjust the exercise scenario and\\ntraining objectives to purposefully challenge, evaluate, and provide feedback on\\nleaders\u2019 ability to think critically and anticipate environmental changes. COL Jones\\nused his opening comments prior to the course of action brief to update the battalion\\ncommand teams on his intent to develop leaders.\\nSECTION II\u2013PROVIDING FEEDBACK\\n2-16. Leaders need to learn how to observe subordinates and provide developmental feedback. Using several\\nassessment and feedback methods provides a robust and more accurate picture of the individual and provides\\nbetter developmental opportunities.\\n2-17. A leader\u2019s ability to provide feedback to subordinates significantly contributes to their development.\\nIt enhances and accelerates learning from the day-to-day work experience\u2014the most valued and effective\\nenvironment for development. Feedback can reinforce (through recognition or praise) or change or eliminate\\n(such as correction, constructive criticism, or alternative approaches) behaviors.\\n2-18. Timely, accurate feedback translates into better leader performance, which in turn, has a positive effect\\non unit performance and mission success. Providing accurate feedback starts with planned observation and\\naccurate observation and assessment.\\nOBSERVATION PLANNING\\n2-19.

It usually takes several\\nobservations before a behavior pattern emerges. Take time to gather information from others\\nobserving the same leader, as different people focus on different aspects.\\nACCURATE AND DESCRIPTIVE OBSERVATIONS\\n2-20. Accurate, descriptive leadership observations are important to assess performance and provide\\nfeedback that produces focused learning. Assessing performance into developmental need, meets standard,\\nand strength categories informs what needs development or sustainment and provides motivation to develop.\\nThese behavior indicators provide general performance measures for varying proficiency levels for the leader\\nattributes and core leader competencies required of all Army leaders (see ADP 6-22). Understanding the\\nbehavior indicators and observation methods provides a strong base to provide others\u2019 feedback, specifically\\nwhen using formal tools such as DA Form 4856 (Developmental Counseling Form), DA Form 67-10-1A\\n(Officer Evaluation Report Support Form), or DA Form 2166-9-1A(NCO Evaluation Report Support Form).\\n2-21. Observing leadership occurs by watching how a leader interacts with and influences others. Written\\ndirectives, verbal communications, and leader actions all indicate how a leader performs. Raters learn about\\nsubordinates\u2019 leadership by observing reactions among peers, subordinates, and other superiors.\\n2-22. The following performance indicators are grouped according to the leadership requirements model by\\nleader attribute categories (character, presence, and intellect) and leader competency categories (lead,\\ndevelop, and achieve). The performance indicators provide three proficiency levels: a developmental need,\\nthe standard, and a strength. For developmental purposes, these three categories are sufficient and apply\\nacross cohorts. A developmental need is identified as a specific need for development when the observed\\nindividual does not demonstrate the leader attribute or competency. Strength indicators are associated with\\nsuccessfully performing leader attributes or competencies. Strengths include a consistent pattern of natural\\ntalents, knowledge gained through learning, and skills acquired through practice and experience.\\n2-23. Tables 2-3 through 2-8 (see pages 2-6\u20132-11). illustrate a focus on core leadership characteristics. Army\\nadoption of a core attribute and competency model means that no list comprehensively lists all performance\\nrequirements for any leader. Each rater, counselor, mentor, or trainer will need to address specific duty or\\nfunctional requirements. Theyshould be able to apply the ideas to specific performance objectives designated\\nfor individuals that exceed the core leadership requirements.\\n2-24. While comparing observations against the leader performance indicators, determine the observed\\nleader\u2019s proficiency level: first review the behavior that appears in the center column, which represents the\\nstandard for leader performance. The column on the left describes performance indicating a strength\\n(individual exceeds the standard), while the column to the right describes performance indicating a\\ndevelopmental need (individual does not meet the standard).\\n2-25. Understanding the competencies and attributes in the Army leadership requirements model is essential\\nto make careful and accurate observations of a subordinate\u2019s performance and evaluation of potential. Leader\\nattributes are inward characteristics that shape the motivations for actions and bearing, and how thinking\\naffects decisions and interactions with others. Attributes support a leader\u2019s development and effective\\nperformance. The core leader competencies apply across all leadership levels while subtle changes occur in\\npurpose and activity at each level and include how Army leaders lead people; develop themselves,\\nsubordinates, and organizations; and achieve the mission. They are what the Army expects of all leaders and\\nare the most outwardly visible leader performance signs.\\nCHARACTER\\n2-26. Character is a person\u2019s true nature comprised of their morals, virtues, values, conscious and sense of\\npurpose, which make up their core and are the mindset and moral foundation behind actions and decisions.\\nLeaders of character adhere to the Army Values, display empathy, the Warrior Ethos/Service Ethos, humility,\\nand practice good discipline.

Observing subordinates requires leaders to find a balance between being dispassionate in their\\nobservation and still being empathetic to their Soldiers. Subordinate leaders who know they are being\\nwatched may behave differently with their observing leaders around. Observation also requires emotional\\nperception. Knowing when a subordinate is overwhelmed, nervous, not receptive, or frustrated is key to\\nhelping them through the development process. Observations should be accurate, descriptive, tied to a key\\nevent and accurately depict a behavior pattern without observer bias.\\nACCURATE,DESCRIPTIVE OBSERVATIONS\\n2-34. Observing behaviors occurs by watching how a leader interacts with and influences others.\\nObservations focus on what was or was not done well and what to do differently. Written directives, verbal\\ncommunications, and actions all provide indications of how a leader influences others. Leaders learn about\\ntheir subordinate by observing the reactions of peers, subordinates, and superiors. The observer must also\\nconsider howto differentiate performance of a desired behavior, the ability and initiative shown to improve\\nor engage in a desired behavior, and the extent and duration of effects that the behavior has on individual or\\nunit performance.\\n2-35. Three key components ensure observations are accurate and descriptive:\\n(cid:122) Plan multiple observations around key events, but also observe routine operations.\\n(cid:122) Look for behavior patterns.\\n(cid:122) Record important observations immediately for use in performance and professional growth\\ncounseling and evaluations.\\n(cid:131) Use words that depict action.\\n(cid:131) Link to effects and outcomes.\\nPLAN OBSERVATIONS AROUND KEY EVENTS\\n2-36. Key training events offer opportunities to demonstrate a considerable number of leadership\\ncompetencies and attributes. Major training events require time to plan, prepare, execute, and assess.\\nTherefore, an observer can interact with their subordinate throughout the event to offer insights and enable\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-13Chapter 2\\ncorrections. Most training events are controlled environments with clear standards for execution, making it\\neasier for an observer to structure feedback and additional event iterations, if necessary.\\n2-37. Training events also allow a unique opportunity for observers to see how a learning leader reacts to\\nfriction, frustration, and, in certain circumstances, failure. An observer can help the observed Soldier\\nunderstand how successful and poor reactions to events affects unit and mission success. Additionally,\\ntraining events can stop and restart as needed to allow an observed Soldier to immediately correct mistakes\\nand address lessons from their observer. Knowing when to start, restart, or stop the event all together requires\\nan observer to be familiar with the level of mental or emotional fatigue a Soldier can manage before they are\\nno longer able to retain oradapt to new information.\\nLOOK FOR BEHAVIOR PATTERNS\\n2-38. With time and frequent observation, leaders gain confidence and start to see a consistent behavior\\npattern. It is a judgment call as to when to consider an observation as a behavior pattern. To observe for\\npatterns, note how often a leader exhibits the same behavior over time. The behavior frequency may indicate\\na pattern. If sufficient time has passed and the observer can predict the leader\u2019s actions, then a behavior\\npattern has emerged. Be alert to changes in performance and causes for strengths, inconsistencies, or\\ndevelopmental needs.\\nRECORD IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS\\n2-39. Important leadership observation details may be lost or be inaccurately recorded if not written down\\nsoon after they occur. A way to capture observations and assessment is to use a quick, accurate, and complete\\nmethod to take notes that supports an effective feedback session such as using a situation, observation,\\nassociate and assess, and reinforce and recommend (SOAR) framework. SOAR elements are\u2014\\n(cid:122) Situation\u2014Describe the assessment situation and conditions. This should include the time,\\nlocation, event, or other situation context.\\n(cid:122) Observation\u2014Describe the leadership behaviors that the leader exhibits.\\n(cid:122) Associate and Assess\u2014Identify and associate the competency or attribute that best describes the\\nleader actions.\\n(cid:122) Reinforce and Recommend\u2014Record how to reinforce the leader\u2019s behavior through praise or\\ncorrection.\\n2-40. Accurate and complete notes are useful when providing leaders with feedback. The SOAR format is\\none way that leaders can record observations; however, leaders might choose to use a different method that\\nfits their own style and needs.\\nUse words that depict action\\n2-41. A leader needs to describe what the subordinate is doing when they are leading. By writing down an\\nobservation using action words, the observer can tell a better story about all the other unseen circumstances\\nsurrounding behaviors, decisions, and actions. Writing an observation down as though writing a story\\nprovides a better picture for the observed Solider, who is often too wrapped up in the leading process (under\\nobservation) and may not see immediate feedback from others or actions.\\nLink to effects and outcomes\\n2-42. Leaders and Soldiers in subordinate echelons feel the positive or negative consequences of a leader\u2019s\\naction. Leadership affects task or mission accomplishment. Understanding cause and effect for a subordinate\\nleader\u2019s actions and effects on a mission or unit is a complex process. Aligning all facts for feedback can\\ndelay the feedback process and requires experience and empathy to balance the need for facts and feedback.\\nLeaders can undermine trust by providing an incorrect cause and effect to a subordinate, which undermines\\ntheir willingness to continue learning tolead effectively. An observer-leader is obligated to seek the relevant\\ncontributing factors to events before providing feedback. While it is not always possible to see everything,\\ncoordination with other staff and trusted observers will fill in gaps necessary to provide richer feedback.\\n2-14 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Fundamentals of Development\\nFEEDBACK DELIVERY\\n2-43. When experienced leaders reflect on their own development, they place high importance on day-to-\\nday, two-way communication with their senior leaders because they do the same with their subordinates.\\nFeedback is less effective if a leader waits until a formal sit-down counseling session to provide feedback.\\nLeaders should provide feedback as soon as possible after observing a particular leader behavior to encourage\\npositive outcomes.\\n2-44. Day-to-day informal feedback makes sitting down with subordinates for developmental counseling\\nmuch easier. This informal feedback develops a shared understanding of the subordinate\u2019s strengths and\\ndevelopmental needs. Still, many leaders find it difficult to sit down with a subordinate to engage in\\ndevelopmental counseling. ATP 6-22.1 provides extensive guidelines on the counseling process.\\nProviding feedback on every observed act, response, or behavior overwhelms a subordinate.\\nProvide feedback based on established competencies and attributes. Focus feedback on a few key\\nbehaviors that, if changed, contributes the most to improved leader and unit performance. Having\\na focus for improvement motivates the subordinate to take action to change.\\nAsk the observed leader for a self-assessment before providing personal views. Do this by first\\nrecounting back to the leader the situation and observation (the first two SOAR sections). Then\\nask the leader to provide an assessment and recommendation. This reinforces three important\\nleader development principles: leader self-assessment and self-awareness, individual leader\\nresponsibility for development, and leader ownership of the recommendation.\\nPREPARATION AND TIMING OFFEEDBACK DURING TRAINING\\n2-45. Before training starts, leaders should explain the feedback tool to the unit and its leaders and general\\nfeedback process expectations. Leaders should emphasize the feedback\u2019s developmental nature. In preparing\\nto give feedback, the observer sets several goals to ensure a successful outcome. An observer finds the best\\nbalance between gathering relevant facts that will provide context to the lesson but without overwhelming\\nthe learner with information. Organizing feedback using a pre-arranged feedback tool helps an observer keep\\nto the relevant material and gives the receiver an idea of what to expect. By discussing feedback formats and\\nexpectations, a leader can ask their observer to focus observations on specific areas where they may feel\\nuncertain or want to improve. Sharing control and expectations for a feedback event between the observer\\nand leader increases the potential to listen and learn and decreases defensive or confrontational behavior.\\n2-46. The timing to discuss leadership observations can be critical and a deciding factor between whether\\nperceiving a situation as evaluative or developmental. Ultimately, determining the appropriate time to deliver\\nan observation is at the leader\u2019s discretion. The observer should be prepared, calm, motivated to share\\nobservations, and be familiar with the conditions that make a leader comfortable with receiving and\\nunderstanding feedback. If an observer is rushed and the leader is frustrated or angry, it may be advisable to\\ndelay feedback delivery. Use personal judgment to consider whether delivery should occur during action, at\\na break in action, at day\u2019s end, or at event completion based on conditions.\\n2-47. Sometimes, leaders deliver observations as they occur or \u201cduring the action\u201d feedback. This is\\nespecially true when pointing out to the leader those actions must occur in the moment to allow observation.\\nHowever, do not disrupt the training exercise.\\n2-48. Find the right break in the action to deliver observations. This could be during a lull after a major event\\nhas occurred (a major success or a failure). Consider waiting until day\u2019s end, especially if observations are\\nlengthy and require discussion. To enable better collective learning, wait until after conducting the unit or\\nteam after action review (AAR). Then, deliver observations to the subordinate privately. This aligns\\nobservation delivery of the subordinate\u2019s strengths and areas for improvement with those of the unit or team\\nas identified in the AAR, assuming they are compatible.\\n2-49. If observation delivery is best done at the event completion, consider letting the subordinate set the\\ntime for the discussion. At a minimum, provide a \u201cheads up\u201d about a situation or circumstance to be\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-15Chapter 2\\ndiscussed. This allows the observed leader an opportunity to reflect and mentally prepare to listen and receive.\\nThis also allows an observer a chance to gather their thoughts, address their emotions, and ensure they have\\na complete understanding of the event\u2019s results for the leader and unit. This approach reduces the likelihood\\nthe subordinate will be preoccupied, nervous, or defensive.\\nOBSERVATION DELIVERY\\n2-50. It is important to plan how to deliver observations to a subordinate. The following delivery methods,\\nwhen done correctly, provide a leader with an understanding of the effect behaviors have on consequences,\\nall based on careful and planned observations. The two-way communication techniques used to deliver an\\nobservation should motivate subordinates to start acting in ways that improve leader and unit performance.\\n2-51. These steps represent an indirect approach to providing leadership observations. Once leaders are ready\\nto discuss observations and reinforce and recommend actions, the following steps provide an effective\\nframework for delivering observations and flow in a logical sequence\u2014\\n(cid:122) Confirm the observed event being discussed.\\n(cid:122) Ask the leader for a self-assessment.\\n(cid:122) Clarify and agree on the results.\\n(cid:122) Add personal observation notes.\\nConfirm the Situation\\n2-52. Start by orienting the subordinate\u2019s attention to the observed situation. State the situation and clarify\\nthat the observation is about leadership. Reiterate the information recorded: \u201cI\u2019d like to discuss the actions\\nyou took in the battlefield simulation you just led with your staff.\u201d [SOAR, Situation]\\nAsk for a Self-Assessment\\n2-53. Ask the subordinate to assess the situation and personal leader actions. Guide questioning to the\\nsubordinate\u2019s leadership during the event or situation. The subordinate\u2019s response should match the leader\u2019s\\nassessment. If it does not, the leader should ask additional specific questions:\\n(cid:122) \u201cHow effective was the communication between you and the subordinates you were leading? And\\nhow could you tell?\u201d [SOAR, Associate and Assess]\\n(cid:122) \u201cWhat factors did you observe that may have contributed to miscommunication or a vague\\nunderstanding among the troops?\u201d [SOAR, Associate and Assess]\\nClarify and Come to an Agreement\\n2-54. Leaders confirm the subordinate either agrees with the assessment or acknowledges a difference in\\nopinion if the subordinate does not share the assessment. Confirm agreement or acknowledgement before\\nproceeding to the assessment, linkages, and observations:\\n(cid:122) \u201cThat is what I saw as well\u201d\\n(cid:122) \u201cActually, in my observations I noted that you were directive in your message and didn\u2019t ask for\\nquestions. Would you agree that this is the approach you took?\u201d [SOAR, Observation]\\nAddYour Observations\\n2-55. Leaders may include observations that the subordinate is not aware. Leaders build on what the\\nsubordinate has already said to increase personal self-awareness. Specific behaviors that affected the\\nconsequence or outcome include\u2014\\n(cid:122) \u201cYour assessment is correct. When you asked for other viewpoints, good information sharing\\nfollowed.\u201d [SOAR, Observation]\\n(cid:122) \u201cIt was clear some staff had differing opinions or other points to add, though the opportunity to\\nshare really didn\u2019t arise.\u201d [SOAR, Observation]\\n2-16 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Fundamentals of Development\\nGiving Feedback in 60 Seconds or Less\\nRegularly providing constructive feedback is important to ensure improved leader and\\nunit performance. Opportunities to provide subordinates feedback are available each\\nday. Review the conversation below for an example.\\nSituation: LTC Smith, the battalion commander, observes a platoon live fire exercise\\nAAR that CPT Phillips, a company commander, is conducting. After the brief, LTC\\nSmith approaches CPT Philips.\\nFirst, LTC Smith provides a brief situation description.\\n\u201cCPT Phillips, I was in the back of the room during the AAR. Let\u2019s talk a minute.\u201d\\nNext, LTC Smith describes the leader behavior observed.\\n\u201cWhen I came in, SGT Jones was describing some friction during the transition from\\nindirect to direct fires. You listened intently to the general descriptions and asked some\\nprobing questions to get more details.\u201d\\nCPT Phillips: \u201cYes sir, I want squad leaders to understand how important\\ncommunication is during transitions on the battlefield.\u201d\\nFinally, LTC Smith provides specific, constructive feedback to reinforce the observed\\nbehavior.\\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great technique to ask a few questions to confirm what SGT Jones said. He\\nsaid he had trouble identifying the conditions necessary to engage with direct fires.\\nYou noticed that. From the excitement in SGT Jones\u2019s voice, I think he knew that as a\\nleader he was in the right place to assist the platoon. If you had not probed for details,\\nthe outcome of that AAR may have been different. Keep up the good work.\u201d\\nWAYSTOFURTHERENGAGE LEADERS\\n2-56. Leaders raise questions that prompt subordinates to think about how to act or respond. Leaders should\\nask for recommendations about how the subordinate will take better actions in the future, avoid problems,\\nand take advantage of an opportunity. Here are some possible questions\u2014\\n(cid:122) \u201cHow will you handle a similar situation next time?\u201d [SOAR, transition to Reinforce and\\nRecommend]\\n(cid:122) \u201cWhat future steps can you take to avoid this outcome?\u201d [SOAR, transition to Reinforce and\\nRecommend]\\nReinforce\u2014Validate a Strength\\n2-57. Once the leader and subordinate agree on the behaviors that contributed to a consequence and a\\nrecommendation for the future, the leader should provide reinforcement on what the subordinate is doing\\ncorrectly. Here are some examples\u2014\\n(cid:122) \u201cYour influencing strategies are working for you, keep it up.\u201d [SOAR, Reinforce and\\nRecommend]\\n(cid:122) \u201cConsider closing out staff meetings with opportunities for questions or discussion. Your pre-\\nmeeting planning and organizing is effective\u2014you should continue that.\u201d [SOAR, Reinforce and\\nRecommend]\\nAdditional Tips for Providing Feedback\\n2-58. Consider these items when providing feedback:\\n(cid:122) Focus on the leader\u2019s behavior and actions.\\n(cid:122) Identify what the leader has control over to change.\\n(cid:122) Use focused questions as a form of feedback to create discovery learning.\\n(cid:122) Allow leaders the opportunity to produce a recommendation to the observation. This promotes\\ntheir taking ownership and responsibility for it.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-17Chapter 2\\n(cid:122) Be familiar with improvement actions described in chapter 4 and offer appropriate ones. Remind\\nleaders that this source is available to guide development, including improving their understanding\\nof positive and negative behaviors and underlying causes.\\nLESSONS FROM DELIVERING OBSERVATIONS\\n2-59. Leaders should avoid delivering some kinds of feedback. Especially important to avoid are\u2014\\n(cid:122) Vague and general ideas: \u201cYou are a good leader.\u201d Instead, focus on specific, observed strengths.\\n(cid:122) Using absolutes or generalities, such as always or never: \u201cYou never follow-up after meetings.\u201d\\nInstead, give specific behavior examples.\\n(cid:122) Observations applied to general traits or the total person: \u201cYou\u2019re an introvert.\u201d Instead, focus on\\nspecific, observed actions.\\n(cid:122) Untimely feedback that the leader is unable to apply: \u201cTwo days ago you gave ambiguous\\ninstructions atthe mission rehearsal.\u201d If they are not able to do anything useful with the feedback,\\nfocus on the future rather than the past.\\n2-60. It is important for leaders to learn from observation delivery and realize it takes practice. It is helpful\\nafter an interaction for leaders to reflect on their delivery. Reflective questions include\u2014\\n(cid:122) Was my subordinate receptive to what we discussed?\\n(cid:122) Based on my questions, how easily did they identify the behaviors that needed to change?\\n(cid:122) Did my subordinate ask for techniques or ideas on how to change or improve?\\n(cid:122) Is there agreement on the next development step and its timeframe?\\n(cid:122) Is there evidence that my subordinate is acting on the observations?\\n2-61. After delivering observations, leaders look for the next opportunity to observe the subordinate\u2019s\\nleadership. Then, gauge how well the subordinate received the observation, what steps the leader has taken\\nto change behavior, and what effect the change is having on unit outcomes.\\nSUBORDINATE RECEPTIVENESS TOFEEDBACK\\n2-62. Trust and a developmental culture are critical to ensuring receptiveness of leader observations. Leaders\\nperceived as genuinely interested in helping subordinates develop tend to have subordinates who are more\\nreceptive to observations and feedback.\\n2-63. To gauge receptiveness, leaders must remain attuned to verbal and nonverbal cues. These may occur\\nas verbal disagreement or resistance, or nonverbal gestures such as folded arms, rolling eyes, or lack of\\nattentiveness. These cues can affect an observer by increasing their frustration with the feedback process.\\nRefocus the subordinate and yourself by\u2014\\n(cid:122) Reaffirming your feedback intent maximizes the subordinate\u2019s capabilities to learn and lead.\\n(cid:122) Restating the intent of your observation as a chance for self-development\u2014not personal judgment.\\n(cid:122) Reiterating what went well, noting growth and progress.\\n(cid:122) Ask why they might not be receptive. For instance, \u201cIt seems you disagree with what I am saying.\\nCan you share what you are thinking?\u201d\\n2-64. Sometimes, a subordinate does not respond to any feedback. When this occurs, the leader might\\ndetermine if an underlying cause prevents a positive response. Ultimately, the responsibility for learning lies\\nwith the subordinate, but an effective leader ensures the best possible conditions are set for continued\\nlearning. Even in difficult situations, leaders use different techniques to gain the subordinate\u2019s attention and\\ncreate learning opportunities.\\n2-65. These are some ways to redirect a non-responsive subordinate\u2014\\n(cid:122) Work with the subordinate leader\u2019s subordinates and peers to ensure their actions do not affect the\\nmission or teammate performance.

Setting conditions and providing feedback and advice are two development fundamentals. Applying\\npractices to enhance learning makes development more effective. Enhancing learning draws on the\\ndevelopmental value from learning opportunities. Learning from experience is enhanced by facilitatingwhat\\nthe experience means. Understanding an experience requires interpreting the event to create personal\\nunderstanding. This process requires observation, feedback, dialogue, and reflection. A leader-subordinate\\npair, coach, or mentor can use these four steps with a leader, any group, or adapted for an individual learner.\\nThis section focuses on how dialogue can bolster the reflection process and understanding. Chapter 3\\naddresses how an individual uses this learning process. At the individual level, experiential learning is\\nlearning while doing. At the organizational level, experiential learning is improving while doing. Experiential\\nlearning is consistent with the principle of train as you fight.\\n2-67. Practical approaches to enhance learning include leader role models, mentoring, guided discovery\\nlearning, and individual and group study. These practices are not scheduled events but are powerful ways to\\nintegrate and promote learning in the day-to-day organizational operations.\\n2-68. Because leaders vary in their skill and experience level, an effective way to learn is directly from unit\\nrole models. Positive role models exhibit leadership behaviors that others should emulate.\\nThe 5-Minute Shadow\\nBring in a subordinate to observe or participate in an aspect of work that will improve\\ntheir abilities. To maximize the experience\u2013\u2013\\n-Communicate the situation, decision, or issue.\\n-Convey the importance of acting appropriately or making the right decision.\\n-Describe possible consequences, second-and third-order effects.\\n-Discuss the decision or actions and reasoning behind them.\\nGUIDED DISCOVERY LEARNING TECHNIQUES\\n2-69. Guided discovery learning is an advanced technique that experienced leaders employ to help others\\nlearn. Leaders use the technique in coaching, counseling, and mentoring situations. Guided discovery\\nlearning is an indirect method that engages individuals to identify personal strengths and developmental\\nneeds, supported by a senior leader. Guided discovery learning is effective when\u2013\u2013\\n(cid:122) A learner effectively makes sense of incoming information and integrates it with their personal\\nbase of experience and knowledge of relevant doctrine.\\n(cid:122) A supervisor generally keeps the subordinate on track through direction, coaching, feedback, or\\nmodeling.\\n2-70. When appropriate, guided discovery learning is more effective than prescriptive methods where the\\nleader prescribes problem solutions to a subordinate. Creating guided discovery learning options for a\\nsubordinate requires deliberate commitment from a leader to resource the learning experience, accept risk\\nthat they may learn a different lesson or learn at a different pace than the leader originally planned. Striking\\na balance between prescriptive methods and indirect methods requires a holistic understanding of how a\\nparticular Soldier learns and leads.\\n2-71. To facilitate effective guided discovery learning for subordinates, a leader ensures\u2014\\n(cid:122) Subordinates have sufficient background knowledge, training, and tools to experiment and learn.\\n(cid:122) Sufficient time exists to experience failure, reset training conditions, and learn from the\\nexperience.\\n(cid:122) The organization has a permissive learning environment encouraging learning without judgment.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-19Chapter 2\\n2-72. Guided discovery learning techniques are an effective way to deliver leadership observations. These\\nmethods are commonly employed when developing subordinates\u2019 leadership skills:\\n(cid:122) Positive reinforcement.\\n(cid:122) Open-ended questioning.\\n(cid:122) Multiple perspectives.\\n(cid:122) Scaling questions.\\n(cid:122) Cause and effect analysis.\\n(cid:122) Recovery from setbacks.\\n(cid:122) Experience.\\nPositive Reinforcement\\n2-73. A leader\u2019s first subordinate observations ought to focus on what they are doing right. Commenting on\\npositive actions up front shows a commitment to balanced and fair observation. It builds confidence and\\nconfirms productive performance that accomplishes an objective.\\nOpen-ended Questioning\\n2-74. Asking open-ended questions gets subordinates thinking about the situation and their leadership\\npertaining to unit performance. Broad questions maximize the potential for discovery. Leaders may need to\\nask additional specific questions if the subordinate is not identifying issues that need attention. An advantage\\nof this approach gives subordinates hints about what they may need to do differently yet allows them to\\ndiscover the actual issue on their own. In this way,responsibility for evaluation is with the subordinate, as is\\nownership for fixing the situation. Open-ended questioning is useful when the leader has time to listen,\\nreflect, and do something about the situation. Thus, the busiest part of mission planning or execution may\\nnot be the most appropriate time to ask an open-ended question.\\n2-75. Open-ended questioning is employed by\u2014\\n(cid:122) Identifying the outcome for the leader to realize.\\n(cid:122) Asking general questions about factors related to that outcome.\\n(cid:122) Asking specific questions and providing hints until the leader connects the outcome with actions.\\n(cid:122) Listening closely to the leader\u2019s response.\\n(cid:122) Confirming and reinforcing what is heard as an accurate assessment.\\n(cid:122) Probing further or offer outcome-based evidence if they are not accurately assessing the situation.\\nMultiple Perspectives\\n2-76. Employing multiple perspectives helps a leader see the situation from another person\u2019s perspective (or\\na different frame of reference). A complementary step to the decision-making process is to understand a\\nproblem and appreciate its complexities before seeking to solve it. Supervisors help subordinates reframe the\\ncurrent situation through open-ended questions or soliciting feedback from other stakeholders.\\n2-77. The purpose of multiple perspectives is to prompt subordinates to think creatively and innovatively in\\ntheir approach. Leaders should use this technique when a subordinate appears stuck with a limited way of\\nthinking or is unable to break away from a mental block.\\nScaling Questions\\n2-78. The scaling questions technique is useful in facilitating a leader\u2019s self-understanding of how difficult\\nor challenging a problem is in relative terms. It facilitates incremental improvement and helps one recognize\\nthat progress has occurred. Supervisors ask subordinates to use a 10-point scale (where 10 is highest or best\\nand 1 is lowest or worst) to assess personal performance on an action or competency behavior. The\\nsubordinate could share what they could do differently to improve performance a point or two on the scale.\\n2-20 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Fundamentals of Development\\nCause and Effect Analysis\\n2-79. Leader actions are often several layers or processes removed from their consequences. The cause-and-\\neffect analysis is a method to identify the root (or original) cause of consequences and outcomes.\\n2-80. It is not always obvious to leaders how certain behaviors affect outcomes further down the line. Cause\\nand effect analysis is important because a leader and unit will continue to experience a negative outcome\\nuntil identifying and resolving the actual root cause. Many times, only subsequent effects (or symptoms) of\\na problem are addressed, leaving the root cause intact.\\n2-81. Leaders use cause and effect analysis to address shortcomings when limited time and capability exist.\\nIdentifying a root cause focuses on remedial actions to fix the problem and change the consequence.\\n2-82. Cause and effect analysis is facilitated through\u2014\\n(cid:122) Asking \u201cWhat (rather than why) causes it to happen?\u201d Show consequences or outcome data.\\n(cid:122) Continuing to ask \u201cWhat?\u201d and \u201cWhat else?\u201d until identifying all causes. It helps to capture work\\non paper or a whiteboard.\\n(cid:122) Depicting the relationships between causes and effect.\\n(cid:122) Identifying which causes, if changed or isolated, would prevent the outcome or consequence\\nreoccurring.\\n(cid:122) Identifying solutions or changes to implement without causing other negative outcomes or\\nconsequences to occur.\\n(cid:122) Coaching the leader on being proactive to avoid negative outcomes before they occur.\\nRecovery from Setbacks\\n2-83. When a subordinate experiences a difficult situation, setback, or seemingly insurmountable challenge,\\na supervisory leader can help restore confidence and prevent conditions from deteriorating. Employing the\\nfollowing enables recovery from setbacks\u2014\\n(cid:122) Reinforcing a strength\u2014a leadership behavior they are performing well.\\n(cid:122) Helping the leader recognize that they are already successfully handling some part of the task.\\n(cid:122) Asking open-ended questions to increase situational awareness and probe for solutions.\\n(cid:122) Providing recommendations if or when the leader is unable to arrive at a suitable course of action.\\n(cid:122) Increasing the percentage of positive reinforcement and support relative to negative reinforcement.\\nExperience\\n2-84. By virtue of position and experience, a leader often knows something is going right or wrong before\\nthe subordinate knows it. It is an art to know when to impart aspects of that experience to a subordinate.\\nLearning can occur by providing leaders with hints, well short of full understanding.\\n2-85. Leaders should carefully weigh the pros and cons of providing a subordinate with hints during training\\nexercises. It is important to allow situations and events to unfold without premature intervention. If the leader\\nprovides information or solutions to the subordinate too soon, the situation\u2019s development value diminishes,\\nas ambiguous or adverse situations compel leaders to adapt and problem-solve on their own.\\n2-86. Yet, leaders do not want to hold on to information that may inhibit learning during the exercise.\\nWithout hints, a subordinate may experience a situation and its consequences, but not effectively learn from\\nit. With hints and additional information, the subordinate launches on a learning expedition while the situation\\nis still evolving. The inquisitive subordinate will follow up on the leader\u2019s hints and find out why systems or\\npeople did not perform to expectations, a valuable learning expedition.\\nCOACHING\\n2-87. Coaching is a development technique used for a skill, task, or specific behaviors. Coaching helps\\nanother individual or team through a set of tasks or with improving personal qualities. A coach gets the person\\nor team to understand their current level of performance and guides their performance to the next level. A\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-21Chapter 2\\ncentral coaching task is to link feedback interpretation with developmental actions. Coaches advise an\\nindividual or team on what levels can be reached and what to do to reach them.\\n2-88. Like other development processes, coaching has several components:\\n(cid:122) Building rapport. The coach builds a strong rapport to facilitate trust and open communications.\\n(cid:122) Gathering and analyzing information. Review performance indicators or leader or team\\nperceptions to determine an accurate picture of capabilities.\\n(cid:122) Addressing the gaps. Discuss specific issues light of similarities and differences with typical\\nexpectations.\\n(cid:122) Narrowing focus. The coach guides the leader to identify the areas to strengthen and develop.\\n(cid:122) Setting goals. The coach assists the leader in establishing development goals.\\n(cid:122) Planning development. Together the coach and leader determine development paths, desired\\noutcomes, and specific developmental actions.\\n(cid:122) Promoting action. The coach sets conditions that help to sustain developmental action and\\nestablish accountability for development.\\n2-89. Coaches can draw on guided discovery learning techniques to establish and maintain rapport and build\\ncommitment. The coach tailors how directive feedback and guidance are depending on the situation and\\nperformance level of those being coached. Coaches involved in developmental actions should find a balance\\nbetween challenge and the learner\u2019s perception of ability to achieve incremental improvement.\\n2-90. To prepare for coaching, leaders study and apply the fundamental guidelines for leader development.\\nThey are passionate learners in the area being coached. They arm themselves with tips, techniques, and\\npractice routines to advise subordinates. Developmental actions for leadership include observing other\\nleaders, modeling what good leaders do, and practicing new techniques or approaches. Leaders can apply\\ntechniques in the conduct of their duties, look for different duty opportunities, or identify outside\\nopportunities. Other actions include reading, research, consulting, and formal coursework. Sometimes\\napplying different mindsets and ways of thinking provide enough development to meet established goals.\\nADP 6-22 provides guidelines for coaching (focus goals, clarify self-awareness, uncover potential, eliminate\\nobstacles, develop action plans and commitment, and conducts follow-up).\\nCOUNSELING\\n2-91. Counseling is the process used by leaders to review with a subordinate their demonstrated performance\\nand potential. See ATP 6-22.1 for more on the process of counseling. Counseling, one of the most important\\nleadership and professional development responsibilities, enables Army leaders to help Soldiers and DA\\nCivilians become more capable, resilient, satisfied, and better prepared for current and future responsibilities.\\n2-92. Regular developmental counseling is an essential tool for developing future leaders at every level.\\nDevelopmental counseling is categorized by the purpose of the session. Understanding the purpose and types\\nof counseling enables the leader to adapt the counseling session to the individual subordinate\u2019s needs to\\nachieve desired outcomes and manage expectations.\\n2-93. Professional growth counseling includes planning for the accomplishment of individual and\\nprofessional goals. During the counseling, leader and subordinate conduct a review to identify and discuss\\nthe subordinate\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and to create an individual development plan using DA Form\\n7906 (Individual Development Plan) that builds upon those strengths and compensates for (or eliminates)\\nshortcomings. Leaders can assist subordinates in prioritizing development efforts based upon those perceived\\nstrengths and weaknesses.\\n2-94. As part of professional growth counseling, the leader and subordinate may choose to develop a pathway\\nto success with short-and long-term goals and objectives. The discussion includes opportunities for civilian\\nor military schooling, future duty assignments, special programs, available training support resources,\\nreenlistment options, and promotion opportunities and considerations. Documentation of this discussion\\nresults in an individual development plan (see figures 3-1\u20133-4 on pages 3-7\u20133-10 for examples). Each\\nindividual development plan will vary as every person\u2019s needs and interests are different.\\n2-22 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Fundamentals of Development\\nMENTORING\\n2-95. Mentorship is a voluntary developmental relationship that exists between a person of greater\\nexperience and a person of lesser experience that is characterized by mutual trust and respect (AR 600-100).\\nA mentor assists personal and professional development by helping a mentee clarify personal, professional,\\nand career goals and develop actions to improve personal attributes, competencies, and skills. A mentee seeks\\nand receives mentorship. Army leaders are encouraged to participate voluntarily in mentoring.\\n2-96. Age or seniority is not a prerequisite for providing mentoring. A junior individual may mentor a senior\\nindividual based on experience or specialized expertise. Having a mentor grows in importance as you become\\nmore senior.\\n2-97. Mentoring is a professional relationship. However, mentor-mentee connections are best when they\\noccur outside the chain of command. This is not contrary to a leader\u2019s responsibility to develop subordinates.\\nIt differentiates between the mentor and leader roles to develop, counsel, teach, and instruct subordinates.\\nSupervisors should refrain from appointing mentors or formally matching individuals with mentors.\\nParticipant self-selection leads to the most effective mentoring relationship.\\n2-98. Leaders foster mentorship by\u2014\\n(cid:122) Educating leaders in the organization on mentor responsibilities.\\n(cid:122) Participating as a mentor.\\n(cid:122) Inviting experienced leaders to visit and share their mentoring experiences.\\nMENTOR ROLES ANDRESPONSIBILITIES\\n2-99. Selection as a mentor is a compliment to one\u2019s professional abilities and competence. Table 2-9\\nhighlights general mentor roles and responsibilities.\\nTable 2-9. Mentor roles and responsibilities\\nRole Responsibility\\nEncouragement and motivation.\\nCandid feedback about perceived strengths and developmental needs.\\nProvides\\nAdvice on dealing with obstacles.\\nGuidance on setting goals and periodically reviews progress.\\nExperiences that contributed to personal success.\\nShares\\nUnderstanding the Army, its mission, and formal and informal operating processes.\\nAppropriate training and developmental opportunities.\\nEncourages Sense of self-awareness, self-confidence, and adaptability.\\nEfficient and productive performance.\\nAsa confidant, counselor, guide, and advisor.\\nServes As an advisor for career development ideas or opportunities.\\nAs a resource for enhancing personal and professional attributes.\\n2-100. Mentoring is a powerful tool for personal and professional development. Mentoring generally\\nimproves individual performance, retention, morale, personal and professional development, and career\\nprogression. Mentoring offers many opportunities for mentors and mentees to improve their leadership,\\ninterpersonal, and technical skills as wellas achieve personal and professional objectives.\\n2-101. It is not required for leaders to have the same occupational or educational background as those they\\ncoach or counsel. In comparison, mentors generally specialize in the same area as those they mentor.\\nConsequently, mentoring relationships tend to be occupation-specific, focused primarily on developing a\\nbetter-prepared leader.\\n2-102. Mentoring is crucial to development and retention. Once the relationship is initiated, the mentor has\\nresponsibility to\u2014\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-23Chapter 2\\n(cid:122) Share organizational insight gained through knowledge and experience. Showing mentees how to\\nmanage a certain situation is far more effective than just talking them through it.\\n(cid:122) Expand the mentee\u2019s network. Mentors advise on a spectrum of topics, ranging from specificskills\\nto broader career goals. Mentees gain sound guidance, access to established networks, and\\nenhanced personal and professional perspectives.\\n(cid:122) Help with setting development goals. Mentees often seek mentors to enable professional growth,\\nperhaps advancement in the organization or in changing career fields.\\n(cid:122) Provide developmental feedback. Giving feedback increases the mentee\u2019s self-awareness,\\nparticularly concerning strengths and developmental needs.\\nMENTORING RELATIONSHIPS\\n2-103. The appearance of favoritism or creating conflict with raters or senior raters should keep leaders\\nfrom mentoring subordinates within their chain of command. Subordinates should avoid approaching\\nsuperiors in their chain of command as mentors.\\n2-104. A successful mentoring relationshipis based on several elements:\\n(cid:122) Respect. Established when a mentee recognizes desirable attributes, skills, and competencies that\\nthe mentor has and when the mentor appreciates the mentee\u2019s attitude, effort, and progress.\\n(cid:122) Trust. Mentors and mentees should work together to build trust through open communication,\\nforecasting how decisions could affect goals, discussing progress frequently, monitoring changes,\\nand expressing enthusiasm for the relationship.\\n(cid:122) Realistic expectations and self-perception. A mentor may refine the mentee\u2019s self-perception by\\ndiscussing social traits, intellectual abilities, talents, and roles. It is important for the mentor to\\nprovide honest feedback. A mentor should encourage the mentee to have realistic expectations of\\ntheir own capabilities, present and potential position opportunities, and the mentor\u2019s offerings.\\n(cid:122) Time. Set aside specific time to meet; do not change times unless necessary. Meet periodically to\\ncontrol interruptions. Frequently check in with each other via calls or e-mail.\\n2-105. The mentee must be an active participant in the relationship. Mentees must\u2014\\n(cid:122) Prepare. Define desired goals for the mentoring relationship. Complete appropriate preparations\\nfor meetings with the mentor.\\n(cid:122) Develop. Work to improve.\\n(cid:122) Be flexible. Listen tothe mentor and consider all new options proposed.\\n(cid:122) Take initiative. Seek the mentor\u2019s advice when needed.\\nMENTORING BENEFITS\\n2-106. Soldiers and DA Civilians who seek feedback to focus their development, coupled with dedicated,\\nwell-informed mentors, embed the concepts of life-long learning, self-development, and adaptability into the\\nArmy\u2019s culture. The benefits are threefold: for the mentor, the mentee, and the organization.\\nMentor Benefits\\n2-107. Serving as a mentor provides many benefits, such as\u2014\\n(cid:122) Professional development. Becoming identified as someone who develops or mentors well-known\\nperformers attracts qualified, high-potential individuals looking for opportunities to work for the\\nmentor. Developing others to follow a mentor\u2019s example facilitates the mentor\u2019s own personal and\\nprofessional development and career progression.\\n(cid:122) Knowledge. Mentees are a source of general organizational data, feedback, and fresh ideas.\\nBecause higher-level positions isolate some executives and managers, mentees serve as an\\nimportant link in keeping communication lines open. Although mentors possess experience and\\nwisdom, mentees often provide important feedback about views at different Army levels.\\n(cid:122) Personal satisfaction. Mentors generally report a sense of pride in seeing mentees develop and a\\nsense of contribution to the Army. It is an opportunity to pass on a legacy to the next generation.\\n2-24 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Fundamentals of Development\\n(cid:122) Sharpened skills. Mentors sharpen management, leadership, and interpersonal skills as they\\nchallenge and coach the mentee.\\n(cid:122) Expanded professional contacts. Mentors expand their network by interacting with other mentors,\\nsupervisors, and various professional contacts.\\nMentee Benefits\\n2-108. Mentees gain tremendously from a mentoring relationship. Such benefits include\u2014\\n(cid:122) Increasing self-awareness through candid feedback.\\n(cid:122) Building confidence and encouragement to grow beyond usual expectations.\\n(cid:122) Having a role model and a trusted advisor.\\n(cid:122) Gaining better understanding of the Army and what is required to succeed and advance.\\n(cid:122) Gaining visibility through opportunities to try advanced tasks and demonstrate expanded\\ncapabilities.\\n(cid:122) Reporting greater career satisfaction with higher performance and productivity ratings.\\nOrganizational Benefits\\n2-109. The organization and the Army as a whole benefit in the following ways\u2014\\n(cid:122) Increased commitment and retention. Mentoring increases the understanding of how to reach the\\nnext responsibility level\u2013\u2013enhancing duty satisfaction and reducing reasons to leave.\\n(cid:122) Improved performance. Mentors and mentees have an opportunity to expand their technical,\\ninterpersonal, and leadership skills through the mentorship relationship. Mentoring helps mentees\\nidentify and prepare for roles which best fit their needs and interests. This enables the Army to fill\\npositions with the most capable, motivated personnel. Mentoring is functionally efficient, because\\ninstead of floundering on their own, mentors help mentees to develop career road maps.\\n(cid:122) Development. Mentoring increases the effectiveness of developmental activities that occur within\\nthe unit and generally produces leaders comfortable with senior level responsibilities.\\n(cid:122) Leadership succession. Mentoring facilitates the smooth transfer of Army Values, culture,\\ntraditions, Warrior Ethos, and other key components to the next generation of Army leaders.\\n(cid:122) Recruitment. An Army-wide mentoring program makes the Army attractive to potential recruits\\nbecause it shows the Army prioritizes its people and their development.\\nMentoring Skills\\n2-110. It is important to possess key mentoring skills to be an effective mentor. These skills include\u2014\\n(cid:122) Listening actively. Focus on the mentee\u2019s main points and whole meaning. Watch body language,\\nmaintain eye contact, and understand which topics are difficult for the mentee to discuss. Showing\\nsomeone you are listening is a valuable skill. It shows you value what they say, and you will not\\ninterrupt them. This requires patience and a willingness to delay judgment.\\n(cid:122) Holding back judgments. Reduce emotional reactions (such as anger or excitement) to the\\nmentee\u2019s comments. Do not immediately draw conclusions about whether the meaning is good or\\nbad until you are sure you understand the comments.\\n(cid:122) Asking the right questions. The best mentors ask questions that make the mentee think. However,\\nthis is not as easy as it sounds. Simply, think of what you want to tell the mentee and frame a\\nquestion that will help the mentee come to the same conclusion on their own. To do this, ask open\\nquestions that a simple yes or no cannot answer. Alternatively, ask direct questions that offer\\nseveral answer options. Then ask the mentee why they chose that answer.\\n(cid:122) Providing feedback. Do this in a way that accurately and objectively summarizes what you have\\nheard but interprets things in a way that adds value for the mentee. Use feedback to show you\\nunderstand what the mentee\\'s thinking approach has been. This is key to helping the mentee see a\\nsituation from another perspective.\\n(cid:122) Resisting distractions. Control the location and minimize outside distractions as much as possible.\\nFocus on the mentee.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-25Chapter 2\\nThe Value of a Mentor\\nMajor General Fox Conner served in the U.S. Army for forty years but is most\\nremembered for his legacy of mentoring a generation of promising officers, notably\\nDwight D. Eisenhower.\\nWhile serving under George S. Patton at Fort Meade in 1920, the two forged a close\\nfriendship and began preparing for the Command and General Staff School at Fort\\nLeavenworth by methodically working through the previous years\u2019 tactical problems\\nthe school used. Because of his work with Patton, Eisenhower was a serious student\\nof tactics when Patton introduced Eisenhower to Conner.\\nEisenhower accompanied Conner to Panama in 1922 as his chief of staff, when\\nConner assumed command of the 20th Infantry Brigade. Under Conner\\'s tutelage,\\nEisenhower perfected his administrative and tactical techniques by drafting formal\\norders for daily brigade operations and analyzing the tactical problems of fighting on\\nPanamanian terrain. Conner directed an intensive reading program that introduced\\nEisenhower to Plato and Tacitus; influential thinkers such as Nietzsche and\\nClausewitz; and various contemporary military writers.\\nDuring Socratic dialogues about the readings, Conner and Eisenhower discussed the\\nnature of war. One important subject often addressed was the difficulty of allied\\ncommand. Conner insisted the Treaty of Versailles made another war inevitable and\\nany future war would be waged by a coalition with the United States as a member.\\nBecause of these dialogues, Eisenhower was aware of the First World War\u2019s allied\\nmilitary command structure defects and pondered the question of coalition warfare as\\nearly as 1924.\\nSource:Dwight David Eisenhower: The Centennial(CMH Pub 71-40)\\nSTUDY\\n2-111. Leader development processes in the organization should establish an expectation for each leader to\\nspend personal time seeking knowledge sources and opportunities to grow and learn. If a supervisor\u2019s\\npersonal involvement and unit resources were always prerequisites for development, it would be a limited\\neffort indeed. Organization leaders should develop distinct ways to study their chosen profession and identify\\nwaysto improve the unit.\\nEncourage subordinates of similar positions or grades to form a community-of-practice group to\\nfoster excellence. Provide the groups reachback capability to web-based forums. Provide each\\ngroup with an opportunity to present recommendations or new methods to the leader team.\\n2-112. Encouraging professional development through outside study and engagement is a way to broaden\\nknowledge, experience, communication skills, empathy, humility, confidence, and an appreciation for\\ndiversity. Leaders can gain a deeper understanding of their operational environment and improve their critical\\nand creative thinking skills. While no limit exists to where leaders may find leadership lessons, mass and\\nsocial media have generated widely accessible options for all echelons of leaders. Some options are\u2014\\n(cid:122) Professional reading and writing.\\n(cid:122) Conferences, panels, and lectures.\\n(cid:122) Podcasts.\\n(cid:122) Online discussion forums, blogs, and social media.\\nPROFESSIONAL READING ANDWRITING\\n2-113. Professional reading broadens leader knowledge, understanding, and confidence. Leaders gain a\\nrefined understanding of the material and develop critical thinking skills through pertinent discussion with\\n2-26 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Fundamentals of Development\\nothers. Discussing ideas and topics with peers, subordinates, and leaders who may offer significantly different\\nperspectives exposes all participants to new ideas and potentially broadens their outlook.\\n2-114. For personal reading, topics may come from established reading lists, stem from personal interests,\\nor follow from determining strengths and developmental needs. As part of a personal reading program,\\nleaders may choose to maintain a reading journal to take notes and record key passages, insights, and\\nreflections. When recording thoughts, leaders gain clarity, develop new ideas, refine existing ideas, and likely\\nshare insights with others. Journals can record related book and article titles for further investigation.\\n2-115. Documents often suggest related information to expand knowledge of the subject. The end of a\\nchapter or book may list related documents. The bibliography or footnotes identify information sources the\\nauthor used. To help narrow the search, note any reference that sounds interesting or relevant.\\n2-116. Individuals should consider writing for publication as a complementary element to a professional\\nreading program. Writing increases self-development as well as develops others who gain from the lessons\\nlearned and stimulated thought. Consider publishing papers created through the writing program in branch\\njournals or as blog entries. This shares ideas and gathers feedback for the author, which could be beneficial\\nin further developing the original ideas.\\nCONFERENCES,PANELS,ANDLECTURES\\n2-117. Conferences, panels, and lectures are a great tool for learning about new topics, observing panel\\nmember interactions, and seeing how lecturers communicate ideas with an audience. Attending professional\\nconferences and lectures in person can be time and cost prohibitive for individuals and units, but the advent\\nof social media and distributed academic lectures can provide a remote viewing option. The ability for leaders\\nto refine their skills at research, presenting material to an audience, and fielding questions or comments can\\nbe an invaluable way to enhance leadership and communication skills.\\n2-118. Knowing where to findconference schedules or lecture events can help leaders identify events best\\nsuited for their learning requirements. Military professional organizations, military history museums and\\nsocieties, universities and colleges, and professional journals are goodsources for lectures, conference panel\\ninformation, and previously presented content. Following these organizations on social media allows leaders\\nto stay updated about events that may be valuable as learning tools. Along with providing reading\\nrecommendations, leaders can provide recommendations for lecture series and panel events that may interest\\nand enhance a subordinate\u2019s development.\\nPODCASTS\\n2-119. Podcasts cover wide varieties of military and organizational leadership topics and can be used to\\nsupplement unit reading or viewing programs. Selecting a podcast for a specific topic equates to helping\\nsubordinates choose an appropriate book, journal article, or movie. It requires leader familiarity with the\\ncontent and the lessons they want a subordinate to learn from the content. Like verifying the credentials for\\nan article or author before including a work in a leader development program, verifying the content and\\ncredentials of a podcast host and their participants is equally as important. Multiple DOD and Army podcasts\\nexist to support professional development programs.\\nONLINE DISCUSSION FORUMS,BLOGS,ANDSOCIAL MEDIA\\n2-120. Online professional discussion forums, leadership-oriented blogs, and social media groups oriented\\non military leadership provide a wealth of mentorship and development opportunities and potential pitfalls.\\nOnline activities and social media are a constant presence in the daily lives of Soldiers, DA Civilians, and\\nFamilies. Understanding how various platforms work, to include who engages and how they engage, is\\ncrucial to Army leaders at all echelons. Soldiers live their lives increasingly online, which influences how\\nthey interact with their peers, leaders, and even the American people. This has real-life effects on an\\norganization\u2019s readiness, cohesion, and environment.\\n2-121. Social discussion forums range from professional discussion forums to informal discussion threads\\non social media platforms. Using professional discussion boards and blogs for leadership questions and\\nadvice can provide new perspectives, creative solutions, and connections between peers and leaders. Informal\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-27Chapter 2\\ndiscussion forums open discussion to a wider, and often anonymous, audience, providing risk and\\nopportunities for leaders and subordinates. Anonymity allows users to engage in frank discussion on\\nchallenging topics that they may feel uncomfortable discussing in person. At the same time, this can create\\necho chambers and subversive discussion that can harm team cohesion or chain of command. Leaders should\\nunderstand the potential for positive and negative professional development and dialogue.\\n2-122. Blogs and video blogs (vlogs) can promote accessible and easily consumable leadership and\\nprofessional development lessons for a wide audience. Professional military blogs and vlogs promote a faster\\nway for individuals to write, publish, or broadcast on relevant military topics. Like journal articles, leaders\\nshould responsibly promote consuming well-researched material. Blogs and vlogs offer multiple topics to\\nhighlight leadership concepts and lessons, even those that are not related to the military.\\n2-123. Army leaders increasingly engage their subordinates, peers, and senior leaders through social media\\nplatforms. See FM 3-61 and AR 360-1 for information and guidelines about building and managing unit\\nsocial media pages. Social media accounts typically fall into two main categories: organization-sponsored\\nsocial media pages or personal social media pages.\\n2-124. For leaders developing a plan to maximize their personal social media accounts, building and\\nmaintaining a personal social media plan can be invaluable to setting personal goals and limits for engaging\\nothers. Selecting the desired platforms requires an understanding of how to maximize the potential for each\\nplatform for individual engagement and development.\\n2-125. For leaders using personal social media to communicate ideas to a wide audience, understanding the\\nfine line between professional and unprofessional behavior is crucial. Using personal social media pages to\\nfeature family, viewpoints, and personal achievements and struggles provides an opportunity to highlight the\\nrealities of off-duty life. Being transparent and professional are not mutually exclusive for all Army leaders.\\nSocial media can offer a wide-reaching option to share the value of professional off-duty Soldiers and leaders.\\nSee AR 25-2 and AR 600-20 for information and regulatory guidelines to manage professional behaviors on\\npersonal social media pages.\\nSECTION IV\u2013CREATING OPPORTUNITIES\\n2-126. Creating opportunities for development or using existing experience opportunities is a fourth way to\\ncreate a development culture. An organizational culture develops based on shared values, beliefs, and\\nlearning. These cultural values, when consistent with the mission, affect an organization\u2019s performance.\\nLeaders foster a positive culture by providing a supportive command climate that values member\\ninvolvement and learning. Likewise, key leader position selections and responsibilities have implications for\\ndeveloping leaders far into the future. Integrating these efforts into a holistic program establishes lasting\\noperating norms. Developing leaders to this level requires investing time and effort but leaves a legacy of\\ntrained and ready leaders for tomorrow\u2019s Army.\\n2-127. Leader selection and screening can be useful in development efforts. Forming leader teams where\\nstrengths in one complement developmental needs in another is a common selection goal. Developing leaders\\nis often about preparing them for responsibilities in the next position. Creating opportunities for leader\\ndevelopment involves\u2014\\n(cid:122) Creating challenging experiences.\\n(cid:122) Sharpening leader selection.\\n(cid:122) Planning leader succession.\\n(cid:122) Tracking career development and management.\\nCHALLENGING EXPERIENCES\\n2-128. Experience is a developmental tool. Pressure, complexity, novelty, and uncertainty characterize\\nchallenging experiences. Leaders create learning opportunities by placing subordinates into challenging\\nassignments to stretch their thinking and behavior. Challenge creates interesting and motivating learning\\nsituations. Leaders create these experiences or ensure opportunities provide learning experiences.\\n2-28 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Fundamentals of Development\\n2-129. All Army assignments inherently provide some developmental challenge. Development happens\\neven if supervisors do nothing at all. Creating the right challenges in a position for a particular leader can\\ndramatically increase development.\\n2-130. Some missions or circumstances may not offer key developmental opportunities. Supervisors may\\nneed to shape position responsibilities to allow a subordinate to enhance personal leadership skills. Before\\nadjusting a position\u2019s requirements, leaders should consider unit and mission demands.\\n2-131. Leaders should be deliberate in placing subordinates in special missions and organizational\\nassignments. Experienced leaders implicitly know the defining tasks early in an assignment and should be\\ndeliberate about identifying these tasks and ensuring each leader gains experience from them. Sometimes,\\nsupervisors must assign subordinates to positions where they do not have the requisite skills or experience.\\nSupervisors should consider modifying position requirements and providing additional support or resources.\\n2-132. Not all leaders develop on the same timelines. Supervising leaders should be willing to adjust how\\nmuchtime each subordinate stays in a developmental position within the parameters available. Supervisors\\nshould involve human resources staff early as decisions may have implications beyond the organization.\\nWhen making such determinations, supervisors shouldweigh the effects on\u2014\\n(cid:122) Unit performance.\\n(cid:122) Leader team stability.\\n(cid:122) Leadership needs of adjacent units, higher units, and the Army.\\n(cid:122) The leader\u2019s well-being and personal growth.\\nIn determining what subordinates need to learn, ask them about the top three skills they need to\\nimprove unit performance. Doing so motivates them and increases their awareness about the leader\\nskills they need to learn.\\nLEADER SELECTION\\n2-133. Supervising leaders should foster an attitude that leadership positions are not necessarily automatic\\nappointments. It is neither a privilege, nor an entitlement, to serve in a leadership position. A leadership\\nposition is an Army requirement to fill a public need to provide for the Nation\u2019s common defense. Therefore,\\nleader selection fills the Army\u2019s requirement with individuals that will best discharge those duties. Selections\\nfor key leader positions require thorough consideration. Each step in a deliberate screening and selection\\nprocess should narrow the field of acceptable candidates:\\n(cid:122) Forecast potential position openings.\\n(cid:122) Identify key leader characteristics.\\n(cid:122) Build a candidate pool by working with higher, adjacent, and subordinate units, as applicable.\\n(cid:122) Use selection tools to screen out applicants such as\u2014\\n(cid:122) Conducting a career file review to identify prerequisite experiences and training\u2014review files and\\nrate candidates against career indicators.\\n(cid:122) Reviewing disciplinary or derogatory information in personnel or intelligence staff files.\\n(cid:122) Obtaining references or recommendations on the leader from trusted sources.\\n(cid:122) Conducting structured interviews with candidates for the position\u2014structure the interviews to\\nassess values, attributes, and responses to various situations.\\n(cid:122) Organizations may develop minimum prerequisite knowledge or skills requirements for specific\\npositions. Final candidates may demonstrate capabilities by conducting a task that proves their\\nqualifications for the position (such as leading a patrol or leading a convoy).\\n(cid:122) Select and appoint approved candidates.\\n2-134. If creating a qualified candidate pool is not possible, supervising leaders should consider modifying\\nthe position or providing additional support or resources to available candidates.\\n2-135. Consider the leader team when selecting leaders. For example, pair a technically strong warrant\\nofficer with a tactically strong officer. Pair a strong operations officer with an intelligence officer willing to\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-29Chapter 2\\nchallenge the operational plan by forcefully presenting the enemy viewpoint. Pair a highly experienced\\nnoncommissioned officer (NCO)with a less experienced lieutenant.\\nLEADER SUCCESSION\\n2-136. Succession planning is a developmental activity for individual leaders that focuses on deliberate\\nplanning to provide opportunities for experience in key developmental assignments and to prepare for future\\nassignments beyond the unit. Unit leaders may not have total input into succession planning but with\\nforethought can have plans to rotate leaders within the unit. Succession planning is a local system of talent\\nmanagement. Senior leaders plan systematic subordinate rotation within the organization so that trained and\\nqualified leaders are ready to assume vacancies, proven leaders move on to positions of greater responsibility,\\nand marginal leaders receive opportunities to improve. Succession planning serves individual leaders by\\nlooking beyond the organization\u2019s replacement interests. It helps develop leaders with the potential to succeed\\nin future positions beyond their current unit and returns a benefit to the Army by optimizing development\\nopportunities and duration across the unit\u2019s leaders.\\n2-137. Understanding the projected career paths and timing for leader branches and specialties is an\\nimportant factor in succession planning. Moving leaders into and out of positions should depend upon\u2014\\n(cid:122) Unit performance. Keeping leaders in positions long enough so that their stability promotes high\\nunit performance.\\n(cid:122) Army need. Providing experienced leaders back to the Army to fulfill its requirements.\\n(cid:122) Individual developmental goals and readiness. Determining when the leader has achieved\\ndevelopment goals and is ready to take on new responsibilities and challenges.\\n2-138. Supervising leaders should work with human resources staff to predict accurate leader gains and\\nlosses to the unit. Be sure to\u2014\\n(cid:122) Account for leader needs for career and position-specific training before position assumption.\\n(cid:122) Assess leaders during their initial assignments to drive subsequent position assignments.\\n(cid:122) Use leader vacancies due to schooling, special assignment, or leave as development opportunities;\\nassign less experienced leaders temporarily to the vacancies.\\nIdentify the key leader positions that trigger succession planning and management. Chart the\\ntiming and sequencing of leaders into and out of unit leader positions. Account for prerequisite\\nschooling and plan primary and alternate candidates for each position.\\n2-30 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Fundamentals of Development\\nGrant and McPherson\\nDuring the American Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant rose to become the Union Army\u2019s\\nCommander in Chief. Along the way, he developed select officers to succeed him.\\nThose supported for further advancement showed three attributes: personal loyalty, a\\nwillingness to do any duty necessary to prosecute the war, and a desire to prove\\noneself in battle. One of Grant\u2019s inner circle gained his full trust and confidence: James\\nB.McPherson.\\nMcPherson was a Regular Army officer who graduated from West Point in 1853 and\\ncommissioned as an Engineer. Eager to find a combat assignment, he joined Grant\u2019s\\nstaff in January 1862 after promotion to lieutenant colonel. McPherson served\\nadmirably as Grant\u2019s chief engineer during the Fort Donelson campaign and at Shiloh.\\nA rising star, Grant promoted McPherson to major general in 1862 and appointed him\\nto command an infantry corps. His successes during the Vicksburg campaign\\ncemented his reputation. When Grant was promoted and sent east, he wisely\\ndesignated McPherson as commander of the Army of the Tennessee.\\nGrant knew the old army adage that \u201cbest friends may not always make the best\\ngenerals.\u201d McPherson had indeed become Grant\u2019s friend over the years. However,\\nMcPherson\u2019s ability to see Grant\u2019s goals and work tirelessly to meet them won his\\ncommander\u2019s full confidence and support. McPherson did not disappoint. While other\\ngenerals sought to seize ground and take cities, he endeavored to engage and destroy\\nenemy armies. McPherson\u2019s army was successful in driving the Confederates back\\nthrough northwest Georgia as part of Sherman\u2019s Atlanta campaign. Leading from the\\nfront, McPherson died in action on 22 July 1864. Grant memorialized McPherson as\\none of the \"ablest, purest, and best generals.\" Sherman called him \"a man who\\nwas...qualified to heal national strife.\" Even John Bell Hood, an adversary, marked his\\npassing with friendship and admiration. Yet while he lived, McPherson proved a sterling\\nexample of how to establish a succession of command.\\nCAREER DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT\\n2-139. Individuals should understand and actively manage their own career paths while supervisors should\\nconsider the career paths and influence their subordinates to gain breadth in development. AR 600-100 directs\\nsupervisors to provide opportunities for a subordinate\\'s individual development. Commanders and other\\nsenior leaders should encourage their developing subordinates to take challenging assignments. Reserve\\nComponent leaders should be awareof subordinates\u2019 civilian development plan as this may affect their ability\\nto take on new and challenging assignments. The ability to see and select the best opportunities for themselves\\nrequires leaders to be equally proactive in advocating for subordinates who request selection for assignments\\nand references. This requires leaders to help subordinates account for all their career development factors,\\nincluding post-military considerations.\\nBALANCING ARMY NEEDS WITH PERSONAL CHOICES\\n2-140. Finding the proper balance between professional work and personal life while planning career\\ndevelopment challenges professionals at all career stages. The Army has experienced significant change with\\nintegrating women into traditional ground combat branches and efforts toward inclusion and diversity. This\\nfosters discussion and understanding about family impacts on a Soldier\u2019s career choices and Army impacts\\non families. Leaders draw on career experiences to help subordinates see how choices affect professional\\ncareers and personal lives. Acknowledging the interrelated nature of a professional Soldier\u2019s personal life is\\na key facet of fostering trust between leaders and subordinates across the force. Most career planning models\\nhave common steps\u2014\\n(cid:122) Perform a self-assessment to determine strengths and developmental needs (based on abilities,\\ncharacteristics, needs, responsibilities, or interest or goals).\\n(cid:122) Weigh the possibilities to choose goals and milestones for self-development efforts.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-31Chapter 2\\n(cid:122) Generate additional possibilities, goals, and milestones to align self-development goals to\\ndetermine opportunities or friction points.\\n(cid:122) Create an IDP that uses effective learning methods.\\n(cid:122) Implement the plans, overcome obstacles, and measure progress.\\nAsk organizational leaders to describe their most valuable leader development experience. Give\\nthem time to think about it before they respond. Have them briefly write about the experience or\\ntell their peer group. Use their experiences to help prioritize implementation.\\nProvidinga first, second, third, and fourth priority reflects the understanding that leaders may not\\nbe able to implement every idea or method. Some development methods provide a leader with a\\nhigher return in performance for less resource investment.\\nPROFESSIONALDEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\\n2-141. Unit leaders are responsible for creating overall professional development programs, comprised of\\nspecific sessions focused on unit needs. Leader professional development programs are deliberate and\\nrepresent a cohesive approach to increasing the skills and readiness of the organization\u2019s leaders. Leader\\ndevelopment programs are an effective vehicle when consistently applied. Successful programs include\\ncommon elements such as\u2014\\n(cid:122) Mission-essential leader task training when a common needexists across the organization.\\n(cid:122) Required orientation or education sessions (such as equal opportunity and safety).\\n(cid:122) Cohesion-building activities to foster esprit de corps (such as dining-ins, sports, or adventure\\ntraining).\\n(cid:122) Opportunities for the commander, command sergeant major, or first sergeant to emphasize key\\nguidance to all leaders.\\n(cid:122) Education sessions on leader career path topics (assignments, schooling, or promotions).\\n(cid:122) Education sessions on the mission command principles, culture, and geopolitical issues.\\n2-142. Professional development sessions, conducted to facilitate discussion and collaboration, are\\nextremely valuable in gaining a greater understanding and applying specific information or skills in a unit.\\nThe information sources and means of conducting these sessions are endless and allow for creativity.\\nInstructors should not rely solely on dry briefings. Scenarios and materials should be tailored to the grades\\nand ranks present. These sessions are great team building opportunities to bring together groups of different\\nranks and responsibilities.\\n2-143. All these applications fulfill organizational leaders\u2019 training and developmental needs. To implement\\nleader development programs effectively, leaders should follow these guidelines (see Chapter 5 for additional\\ninformation and examples)\u2014\\n(cid:122) Link training and professional development.\\n(cid:122) Clearly communicate purpose and relevance.\\n(cid:122) Gather all leaders together only when doing so is the most effective learning method.\\n(cid:122) Consider prior listed applications as integral to leader development programs. Leaders can find\\nmaterials to support professional development from various sites, such as CAPL.\\nTo provide leaders with an in-depth perspective on a mission-essential task for the organization\\n(such as security patrols or convoy operations), supervisory leaders should lead the task in\\nprofessional development sessions while subordinate leaders perform the Soldier roles. By\\npracticing task execution to standard, the organization\u2019s leaders will be more effective at\\nsupervising future execution.\\n2-32 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Fundamentals of Development\\nExample Session: Developing Mission Command\\nUnits that understand mission command principles effectively seize opportunities and\\nmake decisions consistent with commander\u2019s intent. Consider the following steps to\\nensure mission command principlesare a key part of the training strategy.\\nStep 1: Educate the unit on mission command principles. Members of all ranks need\\nto understand the principles and the need for each. Ask the following questions:\\n- Do leaders integrate mission command principles into training opportunities? If so,\\nhow?\\n- Do leaders specifically identify mission command principles when leading\\nsubordinates?\\n- Do leaders make subordinates aware that mission command principles exist within\\ntheir current roles and responsibilities?\\nStep 2: Ask the unit about the roles subordinates play in mission command. Have them\\ndescribe, in their own words, the concepts of delegated authority and making decisions\\nwith commander\u2019s intent. Ask the following questions:\\n-What methods do leaders typically use to delegate authority?\\n- What subordinate actions demonstrate good judgment while exercising initiative?\\nWhich do not?\\n- What opportunities do leaders give subordinates to demonstrate achieving the\\ncommander\u2019s intent?\\n- To what extent do subordinate responses indicate a clear understanding of the\\nmission command principles?\\nStep 3: Review your leader development program and modify as needed to ensure\\nmission command principles are regularly addressed. Consider how training activities\\nsupport subordinates in making good decisions when exercising initiative. While\\ncompleting the review, consider these questions:\\n-What does counseling look like in your unit and how can it be improved? Is it helpful\\nor is it just process?\\n-Does subordinate behavior suggest that commanders trust and support subordinates\u2019\\ndecisions?\\n-Do training events allow subordinates to improve upon their decision-making abilities,\\nin both predictable and unpredictable situations?\\nOPPORTUNITIES DURING TRAINING EVENTS\\n2-144. Training is an organized, structured, continuous, and progressive process based on sound learning\\nprinciples designed to increase the capability of individuals, units, and organizations to perform specified\\ntasks or skills. The training objective is to increase competent leaders\u2019 ability to perform in multiple training\\nand operational situations. Individual task training builds individual competence and confidence to perform\\nthese tasks to support collective training and operations.\\n2-145. Leaders contribute substantially to the unit\u2019s mission success or lack of success. Therefore, the Army\\ndevotes considerable resources to foster leader development during exercises. Providing leadership feedback\\nis a challenging, yet essential, part of training exercises. Leaders have a specific task to observe subordinates\\nduring planning and while executing missions. Understanding how to treat leadership as a skillset to develop\\nand improve is an essential contributor to mission accomplishment.\\n2-146. Where possible, leaders ought to use guided discovery learning. This places the observed leader in\\ncharge of their learning, with the chain of command in a supporting role. Using guided discovery learning\\nduring training exercises prepares the leader to be a self-guided learner in any setting. See Section II in\\nchapter 2 for leader performance descriptions at different proficiency levels to support observation and\\nfeedback efforts.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 2-33Chapter 2\\nMissed Opportunities\\nCPT Williams\u2019 company was tasked to run the battalion M2 range. Knowing the\\ncompany\u2019s high operating tempo while preparing to deploy for an NTC rotation, she\\nassigned the duty to her top performer, LT Taylor. She got several updates from LT\\nTaylor regarding planning and resources for the range; she led battalion range\\noperations before and understands LTC Cano\u2019s expectations. CPT Williams is\\ntherefore surprised when LTC Cano stops by.\\nLTC Cano: \u201cCPT Williams, I understand everyone is busy, but I feel you may have\\nmissed an opportunity to offer LT Taylor some much needed guidance concerning the\\nM2 range. While he had a very solid plan, there was some key information missing in\\nhis brief to me that I feel you would have caught. Did he provide a backbrief to you on\\nhis plan of action before presenting it to me and MAJ Blank?\u201d\\nCPT Williams: \u201cI did not require him to backbrief me, sir. I instructed LT Taylor to run\\nthe plan and his resource requirements by 1SG Diaz while I was focused on other\\ntasks. I did not take the time to bring him in for a rehearsal brief. Guess I hung LT\\nWilliams out to dry.\u201d\\nLTC Cano: \u201cThe mistakes were minor, and the plan was sound, however it is our duty\\nto prioritize development of our leaders, to show them, for example, how much rigor\\nshould go into planning, and how overlooked details can result in serious\\nconsequences.\u201d\\nCPT Williams: \u201cYes, sir. In this case, the fact that LT Taylor has participated in but\\nnever run an M2 range before, I should have prioritized supervision of the 8-step\\ntraining model.\u201d\\nCIVILIAN TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\\n2-147. The Civilian Education System is a structured program with central funding for all DA Civilians and\\nserves as the foundation for civilian leader development. DA Civilians have developmental opportunities\\nbased on their duty series, grouped into career programs. Each career program provides career-planning tools\\nto enable core competency development. The Army Career Development Program provides a planned course\\nof professional development by combining formal training and education with progressively challenging\\nwork experiences. See AR 690-950 for more information.\\n2-34 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Chapter 3\\nSelf-development\\n3-1. The gravity of the Army mission and the world\u2019s dynamic nature make continual learning and self-\\ndevelopment crucial to personal success and national security. Rapid changes in geopolitical affairs,\\ntechnology, and general knowledge require individuals to stay current. Army and civilian schools provide\\nbasic knowledge and techniques individuals need to review and update after they leave school. To thrive\\nprofessionally and personally, individuals must engage in life-long learning and self-development.\\n3-2. Self-development bridges gaps between the operational and institutional domains and sets conditions\\nfor continual learning and growth. Soldiers and DA Civiliansengage in self-development to improve their\\ncapabilities for current and future positions. Self-knowledge is an important part of a leader\u2019s development.\\nThe Army provides tools to facilitate leaders\u2019 understanding of strengths and developmental needs\\nthroughout a military career (see Websites within References). Institutional and operational training\\nassignments cannot meet all learning needs. Self-development is essential to attain and sustain the\\ncompetencies needed to perform successfully. Self-development activities reinforce and expand the depth\\nand breadth of what leaders learn in classroomsand on duty. Self-development activities enable achieving\\npersonal and professional development goals.\\n3-3. Self-development obtains the best results when it is planned, competency-based, and goal-oriented.\\nHowever, an important aspect of self-development is distinct from the other training domains: you are\\nresponsible for directing personal self-development activities\u2014not your supervisor or the Army.\\n3-4. Although engaging in self-development is a personal responsibility, leaders are responsible for creating\\nan environment in which self-development is a priority. Leaders need to be actively involved in developing\\nthemselves and each other. Self-development begins with feedback. Development happens through study and\\npractice. Leaders can support others\u2019 self-development through the exchange of professional development\\ninformation, discoveries, and opinions. As owners of their career and self-development, leaders are ultimately\\nresponsible for managing it. For example, you are the only one who can:\\n(cid:122) Assess your current career status, knowledge and skills, personal interests, and accomplishments.\\n(cid:122) Do you have the technical and tactical expertise you need?\\n(cid:122) Do you have the leadership skills you need?\\n(cid:122) Honestly determine your willingness to invest the time, effort, and mobility needed to advance.\\n(cid:122) Seek information about duty options, development paths, and training opportunities.\\n(cid:122) Set your career goals, develop a plan, establish a timetable, and monitor your progress.\\n3-5. Self-development supports planned, goal-oriented learning to reinforce and expand the depth and\\nbreadth of what a person knows to include themselvesand situations they experience and how they perform\\ntheir duties. The Army acknowledges three self-development types:\\n(cid:122) Structured self-development includes mandatory learning modules required to meet specific\\nlearning objectives and requirements.\\n(cid:122) Guided self-development is optional recommended learning to enhance professional competence.\\n(cid:122) Personal self-development is self-initiated learning to meet personal objectives such as pursuing\\na college education or an advanced degree.\\n3-6. The self-development process has four major phases\u2014\\n(cid:122) Strengths and developmental needs determination.\\n(cid:122) Goal setting.\\n(cid:122) Self-enhanced learning.\\n(cid:122) Learning in action.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 3-1Chapter 3\\nSTRENGTHS AND DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS DETERMINATION\\n3-7. The first step in determining strengths and developmental needs is to think about what you do and how\\nwell you do it. At a minimum, this information comes from self-examination. Examining personal strengths\\nand developmental needs is a skill improved over time. Feedback can come from formal or informal\\nassessments and from other leaders, peers, or subordinates. Outside opinions and information on strengths\\nand developmental needs are useful, however, admitting and accepting discovered developmental needs\\nrequires a leader to be open to accepting feedback and self-aware, which streamlines the self-development\\nprocess. Keep this in mind during a self-examination.\\n3-8. Understanding current strengths and developmental needs is necessary before setting self-development\\ngoals. This requires leaders to be self-aware about their leadership behaviors. These methods help identify\\nstrengths and developmental needs:\\n(cid:122) Formal assessments.\\n(cid:122) Feedback gathering.\\n(cid:122) Situation and self-analysis.\\n(cid:122) Strengths and developmental needs identification.\\nFORMAL ASSESSMENTS\\n3-9. Formal assessments, such as evaluations and tests, are a good place to start gaining insight into\\nstrengths and developmental needs, since they measure individual performance and compare it to a standard.\\nIndividuals use the information and results from relevant assessments to develop their full potential by\\nunderstanding personal strengths and developmental needs. Formal assessments also allow the Army to\\nunderstand the effectiveness of its leader development programs and improve processes through refinement.\\n3-10. Assessments can take many forms and provide insight on a diverse range of factors, including academic\\ngrades from Army courses, practical exercise results, self-reflection on duty performance, developmental\\ncounseling, official performance appraisals, multisource assessments, tests, or dispositional inventories.\\nSome of the more common assessments used by the Army are\u2014\\n(cid:122) Multisource assessments allow subordinates, peers, and superiors to anonymously assess the\\nleader using a standard set of items.\\n(cid:122) Army developmental assessments, such as the Leader 180, Leader 360, or Commander 360,\\nprovide 360-degree assessments of leaders measuring the Army leadership competencies. The\\nArmy uses the Unit 360 to compile individual-level multisource assessments to give unit leaders\\na holistic understanding of theirunit\u2019s leadership capabilities.\\n(cid:122) Army administrative or talent management assessments, such as the Army Commander Evaluation\\nTool, Army Leader Assessment Tool, or the Enlisted Leader Assessment Tool.\\n(cid:122) Intelligence and aptitude tests, such as the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery or Defense\\nLanguage Aptitude Battery.\\n(cid:122) Personality or dispositional inventories, such as the Social Skills Inventory, Social Awareness and\\nInfluence Assessment, Self-Awareness Individual Differences Inventory, or Individual\\nAdaptability Measure.\\n(cid:122) Interviews.\\n(cid:122) Simulations or exercises assessed by trained observers or behavioral scientists.\\n(cid:122) Performance evaluations.\\n(cid:122) Counseling sessions (formal and informal).\\n(cid:122) Skills tests (such as the Expert Field Medical Badge, Expert Soldier Badge, or Expert Infantryman\\nBadge tests).\\n(cid:122) Tests administered in resident and non-resident schools.\\n(cid:122) Standardized assessments proctored during resident schools.\\n(cid:122) Field performance evaluations such as those at the combat training centers.\\n(cid:122) Occupational interest inventories.\\n3-2 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Self-development\\n3-11. Individuals differ in their abilities and assessing their knowledge, skills, attitudes, traits, or potential\\ncan be useful for development and talent management. Depending on the purpose, assessments have different\\nconditions for administration, use, validation requirements, and access to results (see AR 600-100).\\nDevelopmental leader assessments provide individual feedback to enhance performance for current positions\\nor to develop personnel to assume future positions of greater authority and responsibility. Results from\\ndevelopmental assessments are confidential and owned by the individual leader. Talent management\\nassessments support decisions about selection, promotion, placement, or assignment. When used\\nappropriately, valid assessments can increase the accuracy of personnel decisions. The Army owns the results\\nof these assessments, and the individual may or may not have access to the results. Assessments used for\\ntalent management purposes must satisfy higher legal and professional standards with respect to validity\\n(construct, content, and criterion), fairness, and reliability than developmental assessments.\\n3-12. Assessments are not a solution, but rather the first step in the long process of development.\\nAssessments provide individuals and units insight to help drive growth, better leverage strengths, and address\\ngaps or weaknesses. Assessments are useless without developmental action.\\n3-13. Reviewing formal assessments without experience can be problematic. Understanding how to combine\\nmultiple formal perspectives on performance to get a complete picture may challenge junior leaders. Reading\\nand interpreting evaluations and testing results is a learned skill. Performance evaluations provide a narrow\\nview of a person\u2019s overall leadership performance and potential, focusing on specific events pertinent to the\\nrating period. The language can also be misleading, avoiding subtle developmental needs in favor of\\ncondensed feedback for an external audience (such as promotion, selection, and retention boards).\\nPerformance evaluations, aptitude tests, and counseling sessions can provide skewed inputs if not taken in\\ncontext of a larger set of feedback results. Piecing together a performance pattern requires aligning\\nevaluations and tests from multiple sources, accounting for situational context to see patterns, and making\\nassumptions about strengths and developmental needs. Accepting and acting on feedback from assessments\\nalso requires a growth mindset to continually develop and reinforces the Army\u2019s readiness.\\nFEEDBACK GATHERING\\n3-14. Hearing what peers, subordinates, superiors, mentors, family, and friends think can help identify\\nunnoticed or reluctantly acknowledged strengths and developmental needs. Leaders get feedback by\\nobserving how they interact with others or asking directly. Supervisors have an explicit role in subordinate\\ndevelopment. Subordinates should consult supervisors for guidance about development goals or any other\\nself-development aspect.\\nObserve Others\\nObserving how others act toward you and the decisions they make affecting you give\\nan idea of what they think about your skills and expertise. Observing the same person\\non different occasions helps you see trends that may signal a firmly held opinion. One\\nobservation is not reliable, as that behavior may have been a result of other issues.\\nConsider the circumstances. What outside factors influenced their decisions and\\nactions? For example, if your supervisor selected someone else to perform an\\nimportant task, was it because you were too busy or unavailable?\\n3-15. After considering these questions, analyze the answers to determine the opinions that each person\\nconsidered may have of your strengths and developmental needs:\\n(cid:122) Supervisors, raters, and superiors.\\n(cid:122) Who gets the most challenging assignments?\\n(cid:122) Whom does the supervisor rely upon during emergencies or tough problems?\\n(cid:122) Whom does the supervisor praise the most?\\n(cid:122) What tasks does your supervisor assign to you versus others?\\n(cid:122) How does your supervisor react to your suggestions compared to others\u2019 suggestions?\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 3-3Chapter 3\\n(cid:122) Does your supervisor listen to your opinions on certain subjects much more or much less than\\nothers\u2019 opinions? If so, what are those subjects?\\n(cid:122) Peers and subordinates.\\n(cid:122) Do peers and subordinates come to you for help or advice? On what topics?\\n(cid:122) Do they understand you or seem confused or overwhelmed by what you say?\\n(cid:122) Do they repeatedly ask for help or are they one-time interactions?\\n(cid:122) Does their interest and enthusiasm increase or diminish when they interact with you?\\n(cid:122) What does their body language communicate? Isit relaxed, apprehensive, or reserved?\\nAsking for Feedback\\n3-16. One learns a lot about others\u2019 perceptions through observation, but conclusions are only educated\\nguesses unless you ask others directly. To gain perspective, talk to others who know you in different ways,\\nsuch as rater, enlisted or officer counterpart, mentor, instructor, or family member. The goal is to find out\u2014\\n(cid:122) What they saw and their impressions of your action(s).\\n(cid:122) That person\u2019s impression of how well you performed during the interaction(s).\\n(cid:122) How you react in certain situations. For example, \u201cWhen a subordinate challenges your authority\\nin front of others, you seem to get flustered and be at a loss for words.\u201d\\nWho to Ask\\n3-17. These are items to consider when determining who to ask for feedback\u2014\\n(cid:122) Who has been able to observe you enough to offer useful information?\\n(cid:122) Who has observed you from different perspectives?\\n(cid:122) Who has experience in an interest area (former or current supervisor, mentor, or teacher)?\\nThings to Remember When Asking for Feedback\\n3-18. When asking for feedback, keep the following in mind\u2014\\n(cid:122) Respect others\u2019 time\u2014prepare questions in advance.\\n(cid:122) Approach with an open mind to accept uncomfortable or critical feedback without offense.\\n(cid:122) Listen carefully and respectfully.\\n(cid:122) Ask for clarification and examples when points are unclear.\\n(cid:122) Summarize the points to ensure you understand them correctly. Request permission to read points\\nback to the feedback providers for confirmation.\\n(cid:122) Thank the feedback providers for their time and assistance.\\n3-19. These ideas may help you focus on what to ask:\\n(cid:122) Get descriptions and opinions of your behaviors.\\n(cid:122) For feedback about a recurring issue, ask about the situation, your actions, and the usual outcomes.\\n(cid:122) Ask for suggestions for other ways to handle situations.\\n3-20. Look for common themes by comparing the received feedback to identify strengths and developmental\\nneeds. Army leaders must avoid the natural inclination to reject or minimize responses that do not confirm\\nself-perceptions or attribute them to a situation instead.\\nSITUATION ANDSELF-ANALYSIS\\n3-21. After gathering information from assessments, observations, and feedback, reflect on personal\\nbehavior and performance. Examining personal situations and experiences can reveal areas to change or\\nimprove. The situation analysis exercise helps analyze experiences to identify personal strengths and\\ndevelopmental needs. Determining what feedback is crucial to self-development can be challenging for junior\\nleaders who may receive more feedback than they can realistically process for analysis and development. A\\ntrusted mentor or leader can assist learning how to assess and develop.\\n3-4 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Self-development\\nSituation Analysis for Self-development\\nUse these questions to reflect and analyze experiences for insight into personal\\nstrengths and developmental needs.\\n-What was the situation? What happened? Who was there?\\n-What were you trying to accomplish?\\n-What needed resources or skills did you have or not have?\\n-What did you say or think? Were you able to express your point?\\n-What made you feel good (confident, excited) or bad (confused, worried)?\\n- What did you do? How did you act (including body language)? Why did you make\\nthose choices? Did you help or hurt the situation?\\n-How did others react? Did you adjust your actions based on others\u2019 reactions?\\n-Why did you act that way? What knowledge and skills led you to act that way?\\n- What could have helped you handle the situation better? Could you have used your\\nstrengths for a better outcome?\\n-Do you need to prioritize any developmental needs?\\n3-22. After recording the information, look for key factors that influenced the situation and overall outcome.\\nIf the same factor occurs in multiple situations, it may suggest a significant strength or developmental need\\nto develop. By knowing how personal actions, and the associated thoughts and feelings, affected the situation,\\nleaders can become more self-aware and choose the most productive actions. Additionally, a self-analysis\\nmay suggest broader interests to pursue or issues to avoid.\\nComplete a Self-Analysis\\nConsider these prompts while being as specific as possible to identify unique personal\\nstrengths and developmental needs.\\nStrengths\\nThe skill or ability at which I am best is\u2014\\nThe personal quality that I rely on most for my success is\u2014\\nI am most knowledgeable about\u2014\\nThe activities I look forward to include\u2014\\nI would love to learn more about\u2014\\nI am most proud of this accomplishment\u2014\\nDevelopmental needs\\nThe skill or ability that is always difficult for me is\u2014\\nThe knowledge or skill I require to be a better leader is\u2014\\nI do not know as much as I should about\u2014\\nI usually go to others for help on\u2014\\nThe situation that causes me the most frustration is\u2014\\nI am most hesitant when I try to\u2014\\nI am most concerned about my\u2014\\nCompetencies required for my current or future role are\u2014\\nSTRENGTHS ANDDEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS IDENTIFICATION\\n3-23. The final step is to analyze the information gathered from formal assessments, information gathered\\nfrom observing others, asking others, and situation and self-analysis results to determine strengths and\\ndevelopmental needs.\\n3-24. Weight feedback based on its frequency, look for recurring feedback themes or patterns heard from\\nmore than one person. Look at what others identified as strengths and developmental needs and compare that\\nto personal knowledge (from the self-exam) and formal assessment results.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 3-5Chapter 3\\n3-25. Usually, repeated success or expertise in a particular activity indicates a strength. These abilities may\\ncome easily even though others find them difficult:\\n(cid:122) What are favorite things to do or learn about?\\n(cid:122) What do others turn to you for help with?\\n(cid:122) What do recent assignments show as strengths?\\n3-26. Developmental needs are often tasks that are a struggle to learn or difficult to perform:\\n(cid:122) What was hard or not fun to do?\\n(cid:122) What knowledge, skills, and behaviors are required froma position description?\\n(cid:122) Did formal assessments indicate any deficiencies?\\n3-27. Identify where these descriptions apply and develop strengths and developmental needs lists. These\\nlists enable setting clear goals for self-development efforts and can be documented on an IDP.\\nGOAL SETTING\\n3-28. To maximize self-development efforts and avoid wasting time and energy, it is crucial to set self-\\ndevelopment goals\u2014identify personal and professional capabilities to improve and decide what to do.\\nCreating an IDP documents and allows tracking of these goals. This section outlines procedures to\u2014\\n(cid:122) Create and maintain an IDP.\\n(cid:122) Identify self-development opportunities.\\n(cid:122) Plan milestones to keep on track.\\nINDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS\\n3-29. IDPs span across the institutional, operational, and self-development leader development domains and\\napply throughout a career. They provide a framework to identify and document a person\u2019s holistic strengths\\nand developmental needs to guide self-development. In addition to strengths and needs, leaders are\\nencouraged to consider their physical fitness goals; their cognitive abilities to include critical thinking skills,\\ncommunication skills, and technical and tactical knowledge; and their leadership skills with a focus on their\\nself-awareness and ability to employ the competencies.\\n3-30. Once a leader has gathered feedback, completed a self-analysis, and identified personal strengths and\\ndevelopmental weaknesses, they are ready to document goals and a plan to address those goals using an IDP.\\nIDPs take leaders from where they are to where they want to be by incorporating short-and long-term goals\\nalong with action plans to address those goals. All individuals are responsible for developing and maintaining\\ntheir IDP as goals will change over time.\\n3-31. Figures 3-1 through 3-4(see pages 3-7 through 3-10) provide completed example IDPs. These IDPs\\nfor military and civilian members address short-and long-term goals, strengths, needs, and career planning.\\n3-6 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Self-development\\nFigure 3-1.

Understanding strengths and developmental needs determines where to focus self-development efforts.\\nIn addition to leadership assessments feedback, roles and responsibilities (personal and work-related), and\\nArmy needs can provide self-development opportunities.\\nRoles and Responsibilities\\n3-33. Work and nonwork roles have different responsibilities, skill and knowledge requirements, and\\nexpectations. Reserve Component leaders have a unique opportunity to improve both civilian and military\\nskills by linking self-development goals to skills shared by both professions.\\n3-34. Chosen roles usually reflect personal interests and values, but even assigned roles affect the value of\\ndifferent self-development paths. When roles and responsibilities align with talents and interests, leaders are\\nlikely to succeed and be satisfied.\\nAnalyze Roles and Responsibilities\\nList three to four important work and nonwork roles. Next to each role, list the two most\\nimportant responsibilities in that role.\\nIdentify knowledge, skills, or behaviors that enable better performance of these roles\\nand responsibilities.\\nArmy Needs\\n3-35. Another way to identify satisfying goals for self-development efforts is to align personal interests with\\nArmy needs. Soldiers and Army units must be ready to deploy and accomplish diverse missions. Some\\nrequirements may be unforeseen and untrained, requiring Soldiers to use their knowledge, skills, and\\ncreativity to accomplish missions. As members develop expertise, the unit and the Army become stronger.\\nThe expertise range and depth provide unit resiliency and an increased ability to adapt to specific challenges.\\nGeneral Stilwell\u2019s Commitment to Self-Development\\nEarly in his career, General Joseph Stilwell found he had a gift for languages and\\nsought opportunities to develop this ability. Before World War I, he traveled extensively\\non leave through Latin America and Asia, perfecting his Spanish and learning\\nJapanese and Chinese.His unique proficiency earned him an assignment as the U.S.\\nArmy\u2019s first language officer in China in 1919. In 1921, he volunteered to oversee an\\nInternational Red Cross rural road-building project to interact directly with Chinese\\nofficials and laborers to hone his language skills. After a year, Stilwell was conversant\\nin a notoriously difficult language and familiar with a culture alien to most Westerners.\\nStilwell spent most of the next 20 years becoming one of the U.S. Government\u2019s most\\ntrusted China experts. In 1926, he commanded a U.S. Army battalion near Beijing; in\\n1935, he became the American military attach\u00e9 in China. After the attack on Pearl\\nHarbor, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Marshall appointed Stilwell commander of the China-\\nBurma-India Theater and chief of staff to Chiang Kai-Shek, the leader of Chinese\\nforces fighting the Japanese. Between 1942 and 1944, Stillwell deftly used his\\nknowledge of Chinese language and culture to build rapport with Chiang Kai-Shek,\\nensuring Chinese Nationalist forces remained a partner against the Japanese.\\nMILESTONE PLANNING\\n3-36. After establishing self-development goals, create milestones to get started and gauge progress. Use an\\nIDP to document goals and milestones. Milestones can mix short-term and long-term\u2014whatever personally\\nworks and encourages progress. Milestones should\u2014\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 3-11Chapter 3\\n(cid:122) Be specific and measurable: They state what to accomplish so you know if the milestone is met.\\n(cid:122) Be meaningful and relevant: They should help achieve self-development goals.\\n(cid:122) Provide a challenge: Milestones should stretch personal abilities and be challenging to accomplish.\\nChallenging milestones increase motivation; being too easy or hard can hurt motivation.\\n(cid:122) Have a time limit: Time limits provide motivation and gauge success.\\n(cid:122) Be flexible: Build in some flexibility to overcome obstacles or revise milestones if necessary.\\n(cid:122) Be realistic: Ensure milestones are reachable with available resources. For example, if a\\ndeployment occurs in the next 12 months, do not set a milestone requiring college attendance\\nduring that time. Keep in mind that unforeseen obstacles may occur along the way.\\n(cid:122) Be cost effective: The benefits gained must be worth the effort, resources, risk, and other costs to\\nreach the milestone.\\n3-37. Every milestone requires at least minimal planning. After setting the first milestone, create a plan to\\nachieve it. A plan increases success by\u2014\\n(cid:122) Identifying all required actions.\\n(cid:122) Identifying the resources needed to meet the milestones.\\n(cid:122) Establishing time estimates and deadlines that help track progress.\\n(cid:122) Dividing large tasks into smaller parts to reduce being overwhelmed.\\n(cid:122) Identifying possible obstacles and the actions and resources needed to overcome them.\\n(cid:122) Maximizing personal time and other resources.\\nPlan to Meet Milestones\\nDevelop a plan by listing the first milestone. Identify the main steps needed to reach it\\nalong with associated timelines. Consider all the developmental resources the Army\\nhas to offer as well as other sources to reach each milestone. Identify potential\\nenablers and obstacles before beginning to better prepare for difficulties along the way.\\nCollaborating through online forums and interest groups may help personal\\ndevelopment and provide encouragement.\\nSELF-ENHANCED LEARNING\\n3-38. Self-development requires learning. Knowing how to learn is the most important skill required for self-\\ndevelopment. Self-understanding, setting self-development goals, and planning milestones all influence a\\npersonal ability to learn. Effective learning requires\u2014\\n(cid:122) Motivation and persistence.\\n(cid:122) Learning opportunities.\\n(cid:122) Effective learning methods.\\n(cid:122) Deep processing.\\n(cid:122) Learning through focused reading and analysis.\\nMOTIVATION AND PERSISTENCE\\n3-39. Self-development may require hard work over a long period, especially if the goal is to become an\\nexpert in an area or undergo significant personal growth. It takes motivation and effort to keep self-\\ndevelopment efforts alive. Genuine motivation provides lasting energy because it internalizes the goals and\\nthe desire to achieve them. Table 3-1 (on page 3-13) provides tips to stay motivated to make significant\\nchange.\\n3-12 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Self-development\\nTable 3-1.

Is their method appropriate to\\nyour goal?\\nReview what has Think about personal growth and resolved challenges.\\nbeen learned so far Learn from mistakes. Do not repeat them.\\nLEARNING OPPORTUNITIES\\n3-40. Learning stems from deliberate planned activities or unplanned experiences. Maximize each learning\\nopportunity, whether planned or not. Leaders embed planned learning into routine duties with typical events\\nor a separate, scheduled activity as learning opportunities. Take advantage of unexpected opportunities such\\nas cancellations or transportation delays by having appropriate learning materials available.\\n3-41. Unplanned learning happens when something unexpectedly captures your attention. Attune your mind\\nto draw attention to information related to self-development aims by thinking about developmental aims in\\ndetail\u2014what you are trying to accomplish and why you want to accomplish them. Review what you know\\nand what you need to learn. Review key ideas related to the subject as well as who the experts are.\\nPersonal AAR\\nPersonal AARs are in-depth assessments of how your leadership contributes to task\\nand unit performance. Leaders should conduct personal AARs by asking themselves:\\n-What happened and what were the consequences?\\n-How were my leader actions supposed to influence the situation?\\n-What were the direct results or consequences of my leader actions?\\n-How did my actions benefit or hinder mission accomplishment?\\n-How should I change my leader actions for better results next time?\\n-What did I learn?\\nUnit AARs clarify what happened and accurately assess mission accomplishment.\\nEncourage personal AARs following the unit AAR process by:\\n-Walking less experienced leaders through a personal AAR.\\n-Asking individuals what they learned from their personal AARs.\\n-Sharing personal AAR outcomes with subordinates.\\nEFFECTIVE LEARNING METHODS\\n3-42. The purpose of each learning activity determines the learning principles to use to maximize learning.\\nNomatter the purpose, general learning principles apply:\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 3-13Chapter 3\\n(cid:122) Employ all your senses. Memory stores information according to the senses (how it looks, sounds,\\nfeels, tastes, or smells). More senses used while learning enable better memory and information\\nrecall.Involve multiple senses by taking notes, highlighting, reciting, and observing.\\n(cid:122) Space out learning sessions. Do not try to learn a large amount of information or a complex skill\\nin one long session\u2014break the material into several manageable sections.\\n(cid:122) Study the information or practice the skill on multiple occasions.\\n(cid:122) Know the time you learn best and study the most difficult material during that time.\\n(cid:122) Design learning activities so that they mimic reality as much as possible. If the expected conditions\\nto usethe information cannot be duplicated, imagine the conditions as vividly as possible.\\n(cid:122) Familiarize information through self-study before formal instruction. Reinforce learning by\\nreviewing the information after instruction. Review exercises memory skills.\\n(cid:122) When learning an entirely new field, go slow at first to ensure thorough understanding of the\\nbasics\u2014it is important to have a solid foundation to build on.\\n(cid:122) Learn in layers. Start with what you know to determine the first level of understanding,\\ninformation, or skill needed. Learn that level then determine what the information just learned\\nsuggests learning next. Each level builds on the previous and usually becomes increasingly\\ndetailed and interconnected.\\n(cid:122) Learn like a scientist. Scientists adopt the attitude that the best knowledge is subject to change and\\nthat new discoveries may prove old beliefs or assumptions wrong. Start the inquiry with a problem\\nor question. Find evidence that answers the question and test possible explanations to gather\\nevidence. Itis important to discover information that questions or refutes the possible explanations\\nto avoid confirmation bias. Analyze the evidence and develop an explanation.\\n3-43. While the general learning principles apply to all learning types, some learning principles apply based\\non whether the learning activity focuses on learning a new skill, a new behavior, or new knowledge.\\n3-44. Learning or improving a skill requires repeated, deliberate practice. Deliberate practice is not just skill\\nrepetition. Deliberate practice involves\u2014\\n(cid:122) Making your best attempt at performing the skill.\\n(cid:122) Analyzing the attempt results (sometimes with coach or instructor help) to identify ways to\\nimprove personal performance.\\n(cid:122) Attempting the skill again using the identified improvements.\\n3-45. Learning a new behavior about something requires repeated exposure to and testing of the behavior.\\nTaking on a new behavior might involve realizing that a prior viewpoint is counterproductive to obtaining\\ngoals. Changing behavior is done one of two ways:\\n(cid:122) Behave as if you have already adopted the new behavior. If done often with positive results, it is\\nlikely that you will adopt the behavior.\\n(cid:122) Observe another person behaving in a way that reflects the behavior. If you respect this person as\\na role model and see them gaining some benefit from the behavior, you may eventually come to\\npersonally accept and adopt the behavior.\\n3-46. Learning new knowledge requires linking the new information to already known information. This\\noccurs by deeply processing the information youwant to learn. The following section details deep processing\\nand the related critical and reflective thinking skills.\\nDEEP PROCESSING\\n3-47. The ability to learn and recall information depends upon what someone does with the information\\nwhile learning it. Deep processing requires analyzing the new information, picking it apart, using it, and\\nconnecting it to already-known information. Many ways exist to practice deep processing:\\n(cid:122) Relate the new information to something already known.\\n(cid:122) Accept that there may be a difference between new and previously known information.\\n(cid:122) Summarize the material you are learning in your words or diagram it visually.\\n(cid:122) Organize new information into categories.\\n3-14 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Self-development\\n(cid:122) Ask and answer questions to make new facts, ideas, and principles useful and important:\\n(cid:122) How does this relate to prior knowledge?\\n(cid:122) What does this imply?\\n(cid:122) What other examples do I remember?\\n(cid:122) Why is this important to me (or others)?\\n(cid:122) Where else could this apply?\\n(cid:122) Where or how could this be used?\\n(cid:122) Develop comparisons. What does the new information remind you of?\\n(cid:122) Explain or teach the material someone else to test your understanding and mastery.\\n(cid:122) Check multiple sources to gain complete, objective information. Argue both sides of an issue for\\nunderstanding to avoid an echo chamber.\\n3-48. Using critical, creative, and reflective thinking skills are essential to being an effective learner and\\ngaining subject expertise. These skills are essential practices to deeply processing information. Several\\nthinking types facilitate Army leader development and skills\u2014\\n(cid:122) Critical thinking.\\n(cid:122) Creative thinking.\\n(cid:122) Reflective thinking.\\n(cid:122) Strategic thinking.\\nCritical Thinking\\n3-49. Critical thinking skills facilitate learning assessment and problem solving. Critical thinking questions\\nwhat you see, hear, read, or experience. Critical thinking ensures the person is engaged in the learning\\nprocess, critically considering the information or skills practice. Critical thinking requires analysis,\\ncomparisons, contrasting ideas, making inferences and predictions, evaluating the strength of evidence, and\\ndrawing conclusions. It requires the self-discipline to use reason and avoid impulsive conclusions.\\nDeveloping critical thinking skills requires practice. (See ATP 5-0.1 for information on critical thinking\\nprocesses.) These questions guide critical thinking\u2014\\n(cid:122) Who or what is the idea source?\\n(cid:122) What is the evidence for and against this conclusion?\\n(cid:122) What are alternative or competing theories, explanations, or perspectives?\\n(cid:122) Why is this important?\\n(cid:122) What are the implications?\\n(cid:122) Is the argument logic or reasoning sound?\\n(cid:122) Do the numbers, quantities, and calculations make sense?\\n(cid:122) Do the supporting facts agree with other sources?\\n(cid:122) Why or how does this work?\\n(cid:122) How likely is this?\\nCreative Thinking\\n3-50. Creative thinking involves examining problems from a fresh perspective to develop innovative\\nsolutions. Creative thinking occurs by consciously generating new ideas and re-evaluating or combining old\\nideas to solve a problem. Creativity is a willingness to accept change and apply a flexible outlook for multiple\\nperspectives, new ideas, and possibilities.\\n3-51. Identifying hidden assumptions is useful for developing greater creativity and insight. Producing\\nreasons against a preferred conclusion or option instead of favoring that conclusion or option improves\\nthorough reasoning and identifies possible contingencies. Imagine what causes a speculative conclusion to\\nbe incorrect. Considering ways something would not be true allows determining other possible situational\\naspects and ways to shape the outcome to avoid those undesired states.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 3-15Chapter 3\\nFinding hidden assumptions or imagining failure are similar techniques that protect against group\\nthink and hasty agreement with conventional wisdom. Think about what could cause failure. Those\\ncauses are likely assumptions that were not evident. Identifying hidden assumptions can mitigate\\nthe risk of an incorrect assessment.\\nReflective Thinking\\n3-52. Closely related to critical thinking, reflective thinking seeks to build understanding, interpret\\nexperiences, and resolve questions. Reflective thinking requires thinking through the gathered information\\nin detail to organize it, apply principles, make connections, and form conclusions. Table 3-2 provides\\nexample questions to help leaders reflect on their thinking and develop better judgment.\\nTable 3-2.Reflective question examples\\nWhat does this information mean?\\nWhat conclusions can be drawn from this?\\nHow is this information used?\\nFor organizing\\nHow does this fit with my existing knowledge and experiences?\\npersonal\\nWhat are the implications for others or me?\\nthoughts ask:\\nWhat is the big picture and how does this fit into it?\\nWhat is the best way to learn about this subject?\\nWhere should this take me in my studies and self-development?\\nWhat is this situation?\\nWhat other situation is like this one?\\nWhat is this situation not like?\\nFor improved\\nWhat do I know about situations like this?\\nunderstanding\\nHow could this situation happen?\\nask:\\nHow should I think about this situation to define the problem or opportunity?\\nWhat is the real problem?\\nWhat do I not know that I should?\\nWhat else could this situation or solution be?\\nAre any assumptions unneeded; are new ones needed?\\nFor improved\\nWhat constraints are there?\\nvisualization\\nWhat needs to be accomplished?\\nask:\\nWhat is likely to happen?\\nHowshould I prepare for future situations?\\nWhat is the solution or plan?\\nFor improved\\nDoes one solution dominate others? Can the solution be redesigned so that it does?\\ndecision-\\nIs there a specific way to reason and decide about the solution?\\nmaking ask:\\nWhat would my enemy not want me to do?\\nCritical, Creative, and Reflective Thinking Development\\n3-53. Critical and creative thinking come together as practical thinking that captures the strengths of how\\npeople approach everyday problems. Critical thinking brings out differences that are not normally obvious.\\nCreative thinking techniques help generate new insights. Both thinking types fill in knowledge gaps and\\nresolve uncertainty. Practical thinking signs include a willingness to try alternate approaches to thinking,\\nbeing open to others\u2019 positions, being prepared to think about issues instead of ignoring or dismissing them\\nand asking insightful questions.\\n3-54. Leaders must develop critical and creative thinking in team members. The ability and capacity for\\nintellectual and critical thought are essential to effective problem solving. Subordinates\u2019 actions, based on\\n3-16 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Self-development\\ntheir critical thinking skills, often dictate team success. An excellent way to develop critical thinking in an\\norganization is through example, by being a critical thinker. Thinking critically and setting conditions that\\nencourage others to think critically effectively enhance the process.\\n3-55. How people think and feel about learning affects their thinking and judgment development. For\\nexample, an attitude that thinking can resolve problems leads to better results in overcoming difficulties\\nthrough thinking. Attitudes that conflict with sound thinking should be diminished, such as changing one\u2019s\\nmind is a sign of weakness, being open and deliberating among options leads to confusion, quick decision-\\nmaking is how one demonstrates expertise, or truth comes from authority.\\n3-56. Positive attitudes that contribute to developing critical and creative thinking include\u2014\\n(cid:122) Persistence. If one line of thought or action is not working, then finding another line may work.\\n(cid:122) Willingness to expend effort. A willingness to engage in deeper, more thorough thinking is\\nimportant for critical thinking, even when the effort may not initially seem useful.\\n(cid:122) Active fair-mindedness. Making special effort to find out whether one\u2019s ideas will work by\\nimagining what is wrong with them is a good way to be fair-minded. Using the same standards,\\nregardless of the issue or who supports a position is another fair-mindedness quality.\\n(cid:122) Ego detachment. Keeping reasoning separate from self-esteem helps guard against being caught\\nup in being on the right side of an argument or rationalizing why failure was out of one\u2019s control.\\n(cid:122) Uncertainty tolerance. Believing it is fine not to know something is a positive characteristic. Yet,\\nmotivation to resolve uncertainty, once recognized, is even more important. Thinking through\\nproblems, instead of using minimal cues to interpret a situation incorrectly, is an advantage.\\n(cid:122) Openness. Being open to different and multiple possibilities leads to better decisions.\\n(cid:122) Commitment retraction. Willing to change beliefs about a preferred solution or a problem\\nviewpoint is an attitude that has positive effects.\\n(cid:122) Process flexibility. Realize that standard processes will not work for novel, ill-defined, or complex\\nproblems. Adapting or discovering a new way to think may help reach a solution.\\n(cid:122) Willingness to learn. It is natural for leaders to feel an expectation to have the knowledge and\\nexperience to perform well. Being willing to engage in learning is adaptive. One expert\\ncharacteristic is that they understand what they know and what they need to learn.\\n3-57. Thinking ahead and predicting potential ways that a situation assessment may be wrong or that a course\\nof action could depart from the anticipated plan prepares leaders to handle the unknown. Having identified\\nand worked through various contingencies better prepares the team for what could occur.\\nStrategic Thinking\\n3-58. Strategic thinking is an imperative for military leaders to shape the future of operations and to steward\\navailable resources. Strategic thinking is valuable at all leadership levels. It is important to consider the\\noverall situation and make decisions that set the stage for plans lasting years. Strategic thinking generates a\\ncohesive understanding of situational dynamics presenting advantageous options and long-term\\norganizational success. Thinking skills and activities directed at outcomes that produce an overarching\\napproach or plan to achieve a particular aim characterize strategic thinking. In this case strategic describes\\nthe thinking type rather than the doctrinal usage to describe a level of war, security objectives, or ideas to\\nemploy the instruments of national power. In contrast to thinking following traditional problem-solving steps,\\nstrategic thinking is not looking to solve a bounded problem but is creating a decision set or pattern to achieve\\nfuture success. While a tactic specifically prescribes how something is done, a strategy is a philosophy of\\nwhat is valued andconsists of guidelines or boundaries to shape what actions to take.\\n3-59. Clearly, strategic thinking is an important skill for senior leaders to establish high-level goals and\\nbroadly scoped policies. However, strategic thinking is important for junior-level leaders when they address\\nrecurring problems and consider enduring, robust solutions. The earlier leaders are exposed to strategic\\nthinking, the more likely they will try it, apply it, and, over time, improve.\\n3-60. Strategic thinking can be broken down into several activities:\\n(cid:122) Situational understanding. Scanning for recurring, novel, and key cues integrated and used in\\nsensemaking, predicting, and testing what exists enable understanding. Visualization is a related\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 3-17Chapter 3\\nactivity to fill in knowledge gaps about existing or future considerations. Subskills include\\ndiscriminating among relevant cues, integrating diverse information, applying mental war-\\ngaming, and modeling.\\n(cid:122) Questioning. Asking questions demonstrates an openness to different perspectives and a desire to\\nconsider alternate or unconventional assessments. Questioning, a key component of thinking\\ncritically, improves the thoroughness of judgment. Consistently demonstrating a willingness to\\nshift perspective, search for alternate explanations, and avoid mindsets and fixations characterize\\ncognitive flexibility.\\n(cid:122) Systems thinking. Systems thinking involves considering the factors of a situation or a solution as\\nan interrelated system with inputs, processes, outputs, and feedback. A systems orientation\\noperates from a view that an understanding or model can be created to explain or improve what\\noccurs (as applies to situational understanding) or what could occur (as applies to problem\\nsolving). See Army Design Methodology doctrine for more about systems thinking.\\n(cid:122) Analogical reasoning. Thinking that deals with complex problems with unfamiliar or unknown\\nconditions and outcomes occurs by drawing on current knowledge. Analogical reasoning is a\\nspecific approach where known or similar concepts and relationships map to what is yet not\\nunderstood. Historical comparisons are useful in strategic thinking to consider what has occurred\\nunder one known condition set.\\n(cid:122) Self-awareness. Since strategic thinking involves unknowns, multiple paths, trials of what might\\nexist in a situation, and possible solution results, an ability to manage personal thought processes\\nis important. Metacognition is being aware of what oneself is thinking, what one knows, progress\\ntoward a conclusion, and testing strategic approaches and conclusions aboutthem.\\n3-61. Developing strategic thinking occurs by addressing complex, dynamic challenges while practicing\\ncritical and creative thinking, working in context, and gaining basic skills in situational understanding and\\nvisualization. Leaders or instructors can accelerate subordinates\u2019 thinking development by assigning projects\\nor duties with opportunities for strategic thinking. Professional military education courses reinforce strategic\\nthinking by assigning projects requiring skills application and grading how well a student employs them.\\nAmbiguous or Unfamiliar Situations\\n3-62. Deliberate effort applied to thinking is a way to provide best guesses about ambiguity\u2014uncertain\\nsituations, uncertain actions by an adversary, and uncertain outcomes. One way to prepare is to have a\\nstandard question set to ask when faced with uncertainty. Developing a practice of asking questions prompts\\nadditional reasoning. Table 3-3 provides some example questions to focus thinking.\\nTable 3-3. Example questions to focus thinking\\nQuestion prompt Example\\nWhat if\u2026? What if\u2026this assessment was not the case?\\nWhat else\u2026? What else\u2026is happening?\\nSo what? So, what if that happened\u2026is there a meaningful difference?\\nWhat are the specifics? Can claims be confirmed with specific information?\\nIs there a weak link? Are there any inconsistencies or confusions?\\nWhat is unexpected? Are there new conclusions or implications?\\n3-63. It is natural to discount information when it does not fit expectations. Some refer to this as confirmation\\nbias, but that reference implies a conscious or active process when it usually is not. It is difficult to undo\\nsomeone\u2019s assessment or conclusion once it forms. The first step to protect against discounting unexpected\\nsignals is to pay attention to information that does not fit expectations. Assessing the information can indicate\\nwhether an understanding needs to change. If no definite determination is possible, even heightened vigilance\\nfor change should occur.\\n3-64. The dominance structuring technique is a useful way to problem solve to ensure the best available\\nsolution is considered and chosen. Leaders can use the dominance structuring technique in a formal military\\ndecision-making process. It is a way of thinking to iterate through course of action development, analysis,\\ncomparison, and wargaming. The technique adapts to time available and known details.\\n3-18 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Self-development\\nDominance Structuring Technique\\nFirst, consider the relevant problem dimensions. Look for the solution that dominates\\nall other possible solutions on the most important dimensions.\\nIdentify the initial most promising alternative solution by eliminating alternative\\nsolutions that are unattractive on important dimensions.\\nChoose an alternative if it is better than all others on at least one dimensionand equal\\nto other options on other dimensions. This will be the dominant solution.\\nIf the most promising alternative does not initially dominate all other alternatives, then\\nreconsider advantages and disadvantages.\\nIf necessary and when possible, modify the most promising alternative until it\\ndominates other alternatives. This will be the dominant solution. If no dominant solution\\nappears, reconsider the most important problem dimensions to repeat the dominance\\ncomparisons among alternatives.\\nLEARNING THROUGH FOCUSED CONTENT ANALYSIS\\n3-65. Books, journal articles, lecture series, podcasts, documentaries, movies, professional panel discussions\\nmay be key learning resources for self-development. To maximize learning, approach consuming content for\\nlearning differently than casual content consumption. Deep processing is essential to the ability to understand,\\nrecall, and use the learned information. Even though a book or professional lecture may present information\\nin a logical way, the learner must take an active role to understand the information.\\n3-66. The Survey-Question-Read-Recite-Review method uses deep processing principles to focus content\\nanalysis. Developed over 70 years ago, these activities comprise a most widely recommended and effective\\nway to learn from written materials. This same method can also extend to other materials, such as analyzing\\na professional lecture series or documentary.\\n3-67. Survey. Scan the chapter, article, lecture notes, video comments, or other material to build a mental\\nmaterial framework or outline and establish a purpose for consuming it. This mental framework will help\\nunderstanding the material\u2019s purpose, set expectations to draw attention to important information, activate\\nmemory of what is already known, and develop a skeleton of understanding. Survey the material by\u2014\\n(cid:122) Predicting discussion topics. Complete accuracy is not necessary, but it helps active understanding\\nof the material.\\n(cid:122) Noting the title, topic sequence, and their relationships.\\n(cid:122) Looking at graphs, charts, diagrams, and pictures and read their captions.\\n(cid:122) Reading and verifying quotations, vignettes, and other short statements.\\n(cid:122) Scanning footnotes, references used, and presenter history and credentials to sense where ideas\\ncome from or what they mean.\\n(cid:122) Noting emphasized words and phrases.\\n(cid:122) Reading the introduction, abstract, and summary if available.\\n(cid:122) Reviewing other aids that the material may have, such as study guides, advance organizers, chapter\\noutlines, learning objectives, or review questions.\\n(cid:122) Deciding what to learn from the material.\\n3-68. Question. While surveying the material, list questions you want to answer while consuming the\\nmaterial. Developing questions to guide your study increases interest in the material, alerts you to important\\ninformation, helps you stay involved with the material, and relates the new knowledge to what you already\\nknow. To develop questions\u2014\\n(cid:122) Turn the title or headings into questions. For example, if a heading is \u201cThe Four-Step Calibration\\nProcess,\u201d a question may be, \u201cWhat are the four calibration process steps?\u201d\\n(cid:122) Ask questions about graphs, charts, diagrams, and pictures. For example, a graph showing an\\nincreasing rate of traffic fatalities in the United States could lead to the question, \u201cWhy have traffic\\nfatalities increased in the United States?\u201d\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 3-19Chapter 3\\n(cid:122) Consider questions that the author or presenter includes such as in call-out boxes or review\\nquestions. Rephrase these questions so that they are meaningful and easier to remember.\\n3-69. Read (View or Listen). Consume the material one section at a time. Engage several senses by reading,\\nlistening, watching, or taking notes. These tips aid understanding, retain interest, and retain information:\\n(cid:122) Look for the answers to your questions and write them in your words.\\n(cid:122) Look for additional questions to answer and important information that you had not anticipated.\\n(cid:122) Use deep processing to relate the new information to things you already know.\\n(cid:122) Note important information, especially information that answers questions you wrote.\\n(cid:122) Make diagrams that show how a process works, timelines, event sequences, or the relationships\\nthat exist between different components.\\n(cid:122) Respond to points by noting ideas in the margins, a separate notebook, or device. This personalizes\\nthe information and relates it to information already known. For example, notes may highlight\\ndisagreements, how a stated idea relates to another idea learned elsewhere, gaps or questions that\\nremain in the information, or information implications.\\n(cid:122) Look for connections, discrepancies, comparisons, and relationships between information\\npresented in the document and other readings, lectures, or personal experiences.\\n3-70. Recite. Reciting tests knowledge and information understanding. Self-testing is a method of deep\\nprocessing to enhance memory. Reciting helps minimize knowledge gaps.\\n(cid:122) Stop reading or listening at the end of each section and summarize the material from memory.\\n(cid:122) Ask the questions you previously wrote for that section.\\n(cid:122) Explain charts, graphs, diagrams without referring to personal notes.\\n(cid:122) Review the section until you can recite its important information and concepts.\\n3-71. Review. Reviewing helps refresh and strengthen memory and material mastery.\\n(cid:122) Review the material immediately. Review again in 24 hours and again several days later.\\n(cid:122) Review your written questions and see if you cananswer them. Study the material to answer any\\nmissed questions.\\n(cid:122) Explain how all the sections fit together. What are the overarching points and principles?\\n(cid:122) Explain how the information in this document relates to self-development goals.\\n(cid:122) Interaction with a friend or coworker who has studied the same information can help maintain\\nfocus, provide different perspectives on the material, and clarify difficult or misunderstood points.\\nREFLECTIVE JOURNALING\\n3-72. Journaling may track and record the occurrence, actions, and outcomes of various situations. Reflective\\njournaling goes beyond a personal AAR to include periodic entries on self-awareness of personal strengths,\\ndevelopmental needs, values, feelings and perceptions, and questions and ideas about leadership situations.\\nA leader may track personal successes and lessons learned by dedicating time to recording their experiences\\nin leading others, chosen actions, resulting outcomes, and any insights. The journal may serve as a reference\\nto pass along lessons learned to others. Key leader references may be recorded.\\n3-73. Sample reflective journaling questions include:\\n(cid:122) What is the best thing that happened today or this week?\\n(cid:122) What is my most difficult or satisfying work? Why?\\n(cid:122) What do I think is my most valuable or valued contribution?\\n(cid:122) What compliments and criticisms have I received lately? What did I learn from them?\\n(cid:122) What did I learn due to a recent disappointment or failure?\\n(cid:122) How do recent experiences connect to my long-term goals?\\n(cid:122) What risks have I taken (or avoided taking) lately?\\n3-74. Individual leaders should decide whether to share their journal content with their immediate leader or\\nothers. Leaders can reinforce reflective journaling by\u2014\\n3-20 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Self-development\\n(cid:122) Carrying a journal and being seen writing.\\n(cid:122) Citing lessons learned while referring to journal entries.\\n(cid:122) Providing time for a leader to reflect and write down personal lessons learned.\\n(cid:122) Providing leaders with a journal and a personal note encouraging them to use it.\\n(cid:122) Asking leaders to write or recount a story of a key leader challenge and use the stories to pass on\\nlessons learned to less experienced leaders.\\n3-75. Cooperative methods of online journaling, sharing online blogs, or cooperating in message boards can\\nhelp source novel ideas and solutions from a community of like-minded individuals that a leader might not\\nnormally interact with on a daily basis. Sharing ideas, questions, and solutions in an online forum, social\\nmedia platform, message board, or professional blog enables a wider audience to interact and share thoughts,\\noffering an external viewpoint or insight. The same reflective journaling questions still apply, but this enables\\na much more visible and accessible presence to reinforce the importance of reflective journaling.\\nLEARNING IN ACTION\\n3-76. Self-development takes time and effort. Putting a plan into action requires patience and resilience.\\nAnticipating and accepting setbacks as part of the process requires commitment. Acknowledging and\\naccepting that self-development efforts must balance against organization requirements and family\\nobligations is crucial. Having the support of peers, leaders, subordinates, family, and friends throughout a\\ncareer-long self-development effort can provide motivation through lulls in achieving milestones and goals.\\nTo stay on track\u2014\\n(cid:122) Let milestones serve as a guide.\\n(cid:122) Overcome self-development obstacles.\\n(cid:122) Work efficiently.\\n(cid:122) Maintain forward momentum.\\n(cid:122) Assess progress.\\n(cid:122) Make course corrections.\\n(cid:122) Set the next milestone.\\nLETMILESTONES GUIDE\\n3-77. Use the milestones technique previously discussed and developed in this chapter as a guide to\u2014\\n(cid:122) Avoid impulsive actions that may be ineffective and discouraging.\\n(cid:122) Keep the big picture in mind.\\n(cid:122) Work effectively toward self-development goals.\\n(cid:122) Take advantage of resources and overcome obstacles.\\n(cid:122) Measure success.\\n3-78. Adjust the plan as needed to reach milestones. Be willing to update the plan to improve it, change\\ngoals, address obstacles, take advantage of resources, and reflect upon accomplishments.\\nOVERCOME SELF-DEVELOPMENT OBSTACLES\\n3-79. In developing a milestone plan, you identified obstacles to reaching the first milestone. The possibility\\nof encountering internal and external obstacles, despite thorough preparation, is always present.\\nInternal Obstacles\\n3-80. Procrastination, apathy, and pride are major obstacles to self-development and occur for many reasons.\\nSome come to realize their milestones are too ambitious, complex, unclear, or difficult. Others hesitate\\nbecause of the effort or discomfort the work requires or lack the motivation to start. It is easy in such situations\\nto allow other work priorities to distract developmental efforts. Table 3-4on page 3-22 provides techniques\\nto address procrastination.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 3-21Chapter 3\\nTable 3-4.

Recognize what you do to avoid things you do not want to do.\\nKnow Confront yourself when you do these things.\\nyourself Identify self-defeating attitudes and replace them with positive ones.\\nIf you repeatedly delay a task, do you really intend to do it? If not, remove it from the plan.\\nBe open to\\nIf an area is overly complex or uninteresting, consider an adjustment for a higher potential path.\\ndeviations\\n3-81. Poor attitudes interfere with learning and impede understanding and remembering information. For\\nexample, thinking math is hard or disliking history can interfere with learning anything related to math or\\nhistory. Other attitudes, such as closed mindedness, inflexibility, or rigid adherence to beliefs and\\nassumptions, can interfere with learning. To combat poor attitudes, identify a productive replacement.\\nPractice thinking and behaving with a positive attitude until it feels natural and becomes a habit.\\n3-82. A lack of knowledge may be a major obstacle in reaching milestones. Being unaware of the resources,\\nprocesses, and best practices of others who have worked toward similar goals may hinder progress. Involving\\nothers may provide the necessary information and motivation to making progress.\\nExternal Obstacles\\n3-83. External factors such as workload or other personal or professional obligations may affect self-\\ndevelopment efforts. Seeking support from family and friends enables their involvement and awareness of\\nyour milestones and goals and allows them to provide help and support.\\n3-84. Lacking resources is another common roadblock. Resources include anything needed for self-\\ndevelopment including people (such as teachers, coaches, or mentors), facilities (such as schools, libraries,\\nor museums), and things (such as training programs, books, and equipment). Learners best handle external\\nobstacles through careful planning and creativity.\\nWORKEFFICIENTLY\\n3-85. By efficiently managing workload and personal life, one can increase how much time is available to\\nspend on self-development. To increase efficiency\u2014\\n(cid:122) Take care of yourself. Proper food, exercise, and rest enable you to function at your best.\\n(cid:122) Manage time and energy efficiently. Keep a running \u2018to do\u2019 list. Prioritize each task according to\\nits importance, required work, and completion date. Remove low-priority tasks from the list.\\n(cid:122) Look for ways to accomplish daily activities and routines in less time. For example, combine\\nseveral errands in a single trip instead of making individual trips.\\n(cid:122) Learn to quickly locate and obtain the information needed for self-development and other daily\\nlife requirements.\\n3-22 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Self-development\\n(cid:122) Organize work and living areas so that required information, tools, and workspace are available.\\nMAINTAIN FORWARD MOMENTUM\\n3-86. It is important to keep the developmental momentum moving forward. There may be a tendency to\\nslow down after completing an important self-development step or be discouraged by setbacks. Resting after\\na strong effort is natural, but too much rest may make it hard to restart. Maintain momentum by\u2014\\n(cid:122) Keeping a positive attitude: Let setbacks go and start each day with renewed enthusiasm. Each\\nmorning offers an opportunity for a fresh start.\\n(cid:122) Making consistent progress: Accomplish something, however small, related to self-development\\nmilestones and goals each day.\\n(cid:122) Recognizing benefits: Benefits are tangible results such as increased pay, awards, and abilities or\\nintangible results such as pride, a sense of accomplishment, and satisfaction. Remember that\\nimportant benefits often require hard work.\\nASSESS PROGRESS\\n3-87. Assessing progress can provide encouragement to keep going if things are going well or to guide\\nchanges if they are not. Individuals can assess progress at any time\u2014while working toward a milestone or\\nafter completing one. To assess progress\u2014\\n(cid:122) Use objective and subjective measures.\\n(cid:122) Objective measures can be seen or expressed in numbers, such as test scores, time required to\\nperform tasks, number of books read, or college credits earned.\\n(cid:122) Subjective measures cannot be easily observed or expressed in numbers, including feelings of\\nsatisfaction, accomplishment, personal growth, or difficulty. Subjective progress assessments can\\ncome from personal judgment and feedback. Subjective indicators are often sufficient to track\\nmost self-development activities.\\n(cid:122) Compare the milestone plan with what happened and adjust the remainder of this milestone plan\\nor future milestones to account for lessons learned.\\n(cid:122) Timeline: Was the timeline met? If well under or over the timeline, determine why. Maybe the\\ntimeline was not reasonable, more or less work was anticipated, received extra help, encountered\\nobstacles, or the material was more involved thaninitially thought.\\n(cid:122) Action Steps: How successful were you in accomplishing the steps identified for reaching the\\nmilestone? What helped or hurt success? Were the identified steps the right ones?\\n(cid:122) Resources: Were required resources to achieve the milestone correctly identified? Did the plan\\nomit any resources? Were necessary resources available? Are there any other resources that might\\nhave worked better?\\n(cid:122) Obstacles: Were identified obstacles encountered? Was the plan to overcome these obstacles\\nsuccessful? Were unexpected obstacles encountered?\\n(cid:122) Decide if you are satisfied with your progress or if the milestones or self-development goals need\\nchanges. Indicators to consider in making a course correction include:\\n(cid:122) Unsatisfactory progress.\\n(cid:122) Too much stress or effort required to complete developmental activities.\\n(cid:122) Loss of interest in achieving self-development aims or change in the benefits expected from\\nachieving those aims.\\n(cid:122) Changes in professional or personal situations that conflict with self-development activities.\\n(cid:122) Being dissatisfied with personal development.\\nMAKE COURSE CORRECTIONS\\n3-88. Self-development occurs over time in a dynamic environment that includes professional and personal\\nresponsibilities. At some point, obstacles or other challenges force a change of plans. If the progress\\nassessment indicates course corrections are needed, determine what correction is warranted:\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 3-23Chapter 3\\n(cid:122) Goal: A self-development goal or milestone may have been too difficult, too easy, or just not what\\nwas hoped. Examine other possible self-development goals or milestones. Identify why you\\nselected the unsatisfactory goal or milestone. Avoid repeating any missteps.\\n(cid:122) Action Steps: If the actions taken to achieve milestones were ineffective, figure out why and\\ndevelop effective actions.

This chapter provides a deliberate and logical framework to support Army leaders developing\\nthemselves and others. These activities follow the same organization as the leader attributes and competencies\\nfound in the Army leadership requirements model (see ADP 6-22), to help individuals identify and prioritize\\nwhich leader requirements to target for growth. The developmental activity tables follow a standard format:\\nstrength and need indicators, underlying causes, and recommended options to initiate action. The indicators\\nprovide ways to understand leader actions and confirm aspects of each leader behavior as a strength or a\\ndevelopmental need. The underlying causes provide more information on what the root cause may be for a\\ndevelopmental need. The tables provide three options for developmental action: feedback, study, and practice\\n4-2. To best use this chapter\u2019s information, one identifies the competency and attribute behaviors for\\ndevelopmental focus. An individual may already have an IDP that documents goals and a plan for\\ndevelopment or have an idea of what leadership competency or skill to develop. A coach, rater, counselor, or\\nmentor can use this material to help focus leaders or subordinates on specific developmental goals and\\nprepare for growth counseling. Different sources and events inform the process to identify developmental\\ngoals for competencies and behaviors as illustrated in table 4-1.\\nTable 4-1.

While these may be helpful, leaders are encouraged to\\nselect developmental activities that fit with personal preferences and situation.

After identifying a developmental focus, refer to the Army leadership requirements model and the\\nleader developmental tables to evaluate the leader capabilities associated with the selected competency or\\nattribute. Each section is designed to help a leader act on strengths as well as developmental needs. Some\\nmay experience greater growth by focusing on improving strengths rather than focusing on developmental\\nneeds or using strengths to address developmental needs.\\nCAPABILITY EVALUATION\u2014STRENGTH AND NEED INDICATORS ANDUNDERLYING CAUSES\\n4-4. Evaluating capabilities involves identifying personal practices that support or hinder successful\\nperformance. Each table includes diagnostics to enable evaluating how well someone is doing on that\\nbehavior and provides examples of why they may or may not be excelling. Consider if the strength and need\\nindicators represent personal behaviors. Be aware of counterproductive leadership behaviors. Many leaders\\nare aware of such behaviors but choose to overlook or condone them to achieve short-term results, but\\noftentimes some leaders may not even realize they display such behaviors. Each diagnostic section includes:\\n(cid:122) Strength Indicators: Behaviors and actions that contribute to or support successful performance.\\n(cid:122) Need Indicators: Behaviors and actions that reduce or hinder successful performance.\\n(cid:122) Underlying Causes: Examples why someone may not excel at a particular leader behavior.\\nCAPABILITY GROWTH\u2014FEEDBACK,STUDY,ANDPRACTICE\\n4-5.

View all suggestions for developmental activities througha personal lens. The following questions are\\nsample questions to ask when refining a development activity to fit personal needs and situation. Depending\\non the chosen activity, other considerations may be important too. Be willing to take risks and choose\\nactivities outside personal comfort zones to challenge yourself and accelerate development.\\nDetermining Developmental Activities\\nAnswer these to select appropriate developmental activities:\\nDevelopmental Activity: How do I need to improve?\\nDesired Outcome: What do I hope to achieve?\\nMethod: How am I going to do this? What resources do I need?\\nTime available: When will I do this? How will I monitor progress (such as identifying\\nand monitoring milestones, rewarding success, or identifying accountability partners)?\\nLimits: What factors will affect or hinder successfully implementing this activity?\\nControls: What minimizes or controls the factors that hinder implementing this\\nactivity?\\n4-8. Use tables 4-4 and 4-5 (starting on page 4-4) to locate appropriate developmental activities. Leader\\n180 and Leader 360 feedback reports detail individual or unit strengths and developmental needs. Learners\\nand coaches select a few actions at a time to guide development. Additionally, these reports inform leaders\\nof any counterproductive leadership behaviors others have observed in them.\\n4-9.

Neither could answer\\nthe question.\\nLTC Day: \u201cGentlemen, your plan is sound, and the outcome will be trained teams ready\\nto move into greater collective training, but we are missing an opportunity to develop\\nour leaders here. Training without thought of the LRM is like an unguided missile, it\\ngets the job done, but we owe it to our subordinate leaders to be precise. Don\u2019t let\\nleader development just happen, be deliberate and actively plan for it.\u201d\\nCPT Kenny and 1SG Mac return to their office to discuss what LTC Day said.\\nCPT Kenny: \u201cI understand what LTC Day said, and I know our leaders need some\\nwork. We have both worked with them on their IDPs. Several things almost derailed\\nour individual training leading up to this, mostly centered on communication. What\\nshould we do to focus on that?\u201d\\n1SG Mac: \u201cWe wanted to get better tactically, but maybe we should have been more\\nspecific. We know what we want to improve, we just didn\u2019t select competencies to work\\non. Perhaps we can alter our training scenarios to deliberately target communication\\nbetween leaders.\u201d\\nAfter NTC, the OC/T, CPT Smole, is conducting the final AAR with the company.\\nCPT Smole: \u201cLet me begin by saying that it was truly a pleasure to watch this company\\noperate during this rotation.

Nor would I\\nhave thought that it would work. Once we figured it out though, we incorporated it into\\neverything we did and every leader could always tell me what the training objective,\\nand developmental objective, for every event was. I had no greater pleasure as a\\ncompany commander than deliberately developing my subordinates and watching\\nthem progress into great leaders in their own right.\\n~from the diary of CPT Kenny (former company commander)\\nARMY VALUES\\n4-10.

Empathy is defined as the ability to share and understand someone else\u2019s feelings. The capacity for\\nempathy is an important attribute for leaders to possess. Empathy can allow leaders to understand how their\\nactions affect others. The ability to see something from another person\u2019s viewpoint, to identify with, and\\nenter into another person\u2019s feelings and emotions, enables the Army leader to better interact with others.\\n4-16. Army leaders show empathy when they genuinely relate to another person\u2019s situation, motives, and\\nfeelings. Empathy does not necessarily mean sympathy, but identification leading to a deeper understanding.\\nEmpathy allows the leader to anticipate what others are experiencing and envision how decisions or actions\\naffect others.\\n4-17. Leaders with a capacity for empathy can apply it to understanding and anticipating the reactions of DA\\nCivilians, Soldiers and their Families, and local populations. Empathy helps a leader take care of Soldiers\\nand others and demonstrate respect. Army leaders take care of Soldiers and DA Civilians by giving them the\\ntraining, equipment and support needed to accomplish the mission. They value balance between mission\\nrequirements and the welfare of their followers. It improves morale, climate, decision-making, and readiness.\\nThe attribute empathy has one component: Identify with another person\u2019s feelings and emotions.\\n4-18. Army leaders must be able to understand different personal value systems and that these values directly\\ninfluence how others feel about various circumstances, situations, and decisions. Being able to put oneself in\\nanother\u2019s situation to identify with their feelings is important to develop a full understanding of others to\\nmake better decisions and adapt interactions with others (see table 4-9 on page 4-9).\\n4-8 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Learning and Developmental Activities\\nTable 4-9.

The Warrior Ethos refers to the professional attitudes and beliefs that characterize the American\\nSoldier. It reflects a Soldier\u2019s selfless commitment to the Nation, mission, unit, and fellow Soldiers.

Discipline is a mindset for a unit or an organization to practice sustained, systematic actions to reach\\nand promote a capability to perform its military function. Often this involves attending to organization and\\nadministration details, which are less urgent than an organization\\'s key tasks, but necessary for efficiency\\nand long-term effectiveness. Making the right choices involves discipline. Discipline is a reinforcing function\\nto character. Self-discipline is everyone\u2019s responsibility, while leaders also are responsible for unit discipline.\\nDevelopment relies on self-discipline to put others\u2019 needs ahead of personal comfort and desires.

The attribute humility has one component: Seek\\nfeedback and explore personal performance (see table 4-12).\\n4-24. Humility exists on a continuum. Effective leaders exhibit an appropriate degree of humility. Others\\nview a leader who expresses excess humility as being meek, timid, or overly passive. Conversely, others\\nconsider a leader who expresses too little humility as overconfident or arrogant. A leader lacking self-\\nconfidence may feel the need to hide any perception of weakness and may display arrogant behavior as a\\nresult while a self-confident individual is free to demonstrate humility. A leader who expresses too much or\\ntoo little humility lacks self-awareness. This, in turn undermines confidence in the leader\u2019s ability to make\\ngood decisions and achieve success.\\nTable 4-12.

Efforts to develop leaders yield better results if the focus is on proven methods. Army leadership\\nrequires establishing interpersonal relationships based on trust and setting the example for subordinates,\\npeers, and superiors. In leader development surveys, leaders ranked leading a unit, personal examples, and\\nmentoring as the three most effective ways to develop their leadership qualities. Integrating leader\\ndevelopmentfundamentalsinto an organization creates a positive, learning climate and builds a mindset that\\nprioritizes development. Experience is a powerful learning tool, although it does not guarantee learning. As\\nthe leader development tenets convey, learning requires commitment and purpose.\\n5-2. Leader development benefits both individuals and the organization. The Army is known for its success\\nin developing leaders rapidly. Many development opportunities occur in organizations, though not always\\nused for their learning value. Without intent or a program for leader development, organizational emphasis\\non learning follows commander interest and unit climate. Leader development programs leverage\\nopportunities to address individual and organizational goals for development.\\n5-3. Commanders are responsible for training and leader development in their units and for providing a\\nculture in which learning takes place. They must deliberately plan, prepare, execute, and assess training and\\ndevelopment as part of their overall operations. Commanders and leaders must integrate leader development\\ninto their organizational training plans.\\n5-4. Developing Army leaders at all levels, military and civilian, is the best means to ensure the Army\\nadapts to future uncertainties. In this sense, leader development directly relates to Army readiness.\\nIndividuals who feel the Army and their leaders are interested in them are motivated to demonstrate greater\\ninitiative and to engage fully in leader development. Development programs that integrate professional and\\npersonal goals are the most effective. Program content needs to account for the individual\u2019s competence,\\ncharacter, and commitment to develop the attributes and competencies desired of Army leaders.\\n5-5. Organizational leader development programs must nest in purpose and guidance with the higher\\norganization\u2019s program. Programs should be consistent with Army enterprise concepts, strategy, and\\nguidance on leader development. Programs should provide guidance to subordinate units yet allow freedom\\nto determine practices and schedules most conducive to their missions. Programs up and down an\\norganizational structure need to align to create synergy and unity of effort. A battalion or equivalent-sized\\nleader development program should identify specific processes supporting development. Generating force\\norganizations headed by a colonel or similar ranking DA Civilian are a good target for programs that detail\\nspecific processes. A battalion program should anticipate the needs of and execution by its subordinate units.\\n5-6. Variations in programs occur across echelons depending on the organization type and size. For\\nexample, a division has greater latitude in selecting leaders for special assignments than does a battalion due\\nto the wider scope of opportunities and larger number of leaders. A Reserve Component unit has fewer\\ntraining days to plan and schedule team building events, so there may be a greater role for self-development\\nand mentoring. Detached and dispersed units have fewer organic assets to prepare and conduct special events\\nbut may have access to external opportunities, such as a training detachment on a university campus.\\n5-7. The Army holds commanders accountable for unit leader development by regulation (see AR 350-1).\\nAccountability can be included as part of the organizational inspection program (see AR 1-201).\\nResponsibility for leader development cuts across all leader and staff roles.

How are the 1SGs doing?\u201d\\nCSM Undeu: \u201cThey\u2019re running a little ragged from the training timeline but are holding\\nup.\u201d\\nCSM Sash: \u201cHow are you incorporating developmental opportunities for your 1SGs\\nduring this event? Remember, even though they are not the target for this event, we\\ncan still challenge and develop them. The systems they use to track their platoons\\nshouldn\u2019t be different from what they will use in combat. The brigade needs your help\\nin identifying developmental strengths and needs at the 1SG/commander level to\\nensure that we are seeing ourselves accurately. Find a way to assess your command\\nteams during events like this, otherwise you\u2019ll miss things that are critical to the\\nbrigade\u2019s success.\u201d\\nCSM Undeu: \u201cI take your point. I got too focused on the platoons since this event\\ncenters on them. I completely missed how observations, assessments, and feedback\\non the next level up reinforces brigade training and leader development objectives.\u201d\\nCSM Sash: \u201cThe focus should be at the platoon-level, and you are doing that well. It is\\nalso important to take this opportunity to help the brigade see itself since gaps you\\nmight find may extend across the rest of the brigade. It helps the brigade commander\\nand me confirm or deny what we think are individual and collective developmental\\nneeds at the company level.\u201d\\n5-8. The next-higher echelon commander, human resources and operations staff, and senior cohort leaders\\nmust clarify development roles and responsibilities. These individuals directly and indirectly affect the\\nefficiency and effectiveness of leader development.\\nDelineating Responsibilities\\nEfficiently implementing leader development programs depends on clearly defining\\nand allocating responsibilities across leaders and staff both in and outside the\\norganization. Develop a matrix to document notes on theroles and responsibilities for\\ndeveloping leaders in the organization.\\nUNIT LEADER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\\n5-9. Leader development is a mindset and process, not merely an event, reflected by everything leaders do.\\nAn opportunity for development exists in every event, class, assignment, duty position, discussion, physical\\ntraining formation, briefing, and engagement. Leader development is a continual and purposeful process. It\\nis an ongoing process intended to achieve incremental and progressive results over time.\\n5-2 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Program Development\\nPROGRAM CREATION\\n5-10. Various types and echelons of commands and organizations label their leader development guidance\\nwith different descriptions such as strategy, philosophy, policy, memorandum, plan, or standing procedure.\\nThe title and format are less important than having a good plan\u2014one that aligns with the leader development\\ntenets: committed organization; clear purpose; supportive learning culture; enabler of education, training,\\nand experience; and feedback. The plan helps to inspire and guide the organization to engage in development.\\nPrograms that incorporate leader development into daily operations without creating extra events are well\\nreceived and have the greatest chance for effective implementation. Having a plan brings attention to leader\\ndevelopment, provides focus and purpose, encourages the mindset, sets conditions, shows how development\\nshould occur, and coordinates efforts across the organization.\\n5-11. Developing a leader development program follows the same steps used in the operations process (see\\nADP 5-0). Planning involves understanding a situation, envisioning a desired future, and planning effective\\nways to achieve that future. The program should allow for disciplined initiative by subordinate units and\\nindividual leaders. A leader development program is specific because the outcomes need to address both\\norganizational and individual goals as well as short-term and long-term goals. The long-term focus extends\\nbeyond a commander\u2019s tour and beyond the member\u2019s time in the unit. Most DA Civilian leaders are not\\nreassigned based on time, though leader development programs like those in operational units often serve\\ntheir needs. Once the commander\u2019s visualization is described and the program plan is developed, they direct\\npreparing and executing the unit\u2019s leader development program. The commander and unit leaders execute\\nthe program and assess its progress. The leader development program creates change in the organization and\\nin individuals\u2014it is a living document. As leaders develop, update the program plan.\\nUnderstand\\n5-12. To aid understanding, leader teams can use formal assessments such as command climate surveys,\\naggregated trends from leader assessments, unit-level assessments (such as Unit 360 or Army Readiness\\nAssessment Program), training center AAR take-home packages, and command inspection program results\\nto focus on conditions indicating unit strengths and developmental needs. Even an analysis of all unit\\nmembers\u2019 IDPs can provide detail on where to focus or where developmental gaps may exist. The leader\\nteam takes these various information sources along with their own observations and discussions with\\nsubordinates and colleagues to determine an appropriate focus. Table 5-1 lists external and internal\\ninformation sources leaders can use to shape and inform an assessment of their organization.\\nTable 5-1.

The battalion struggles with last-minute maintenance and\\nsupply issues which causes a lot of unpredictability for its Soldiers.\\nCSM Baker: \u201cYou all were in the training meeting last week.

Those engagements can be a developmental opportunity for them. This can\\nfree up some of our senior leaders to focus on implementing the commander\u2019s\\nguidance. Provide feedback to those you delegate responsibility to.\u201d\\n1SG Morton: \u201cAcknowledge all sergeant major. We\u2019ll continue to use these\\nopportunities to develop our leaders. I have several corporals and specialists that could\\nhandle some of the things I would usually task a sergeant with.\u201d\\nCSM Baker: \u201cThat\u2019s right. I will work at the battalion level to protect your time, but you\\nare responsible for using it. Don\u2019t let your commanders plan in a vacuum, be involved\\nand proactive in developing your people. Look for innovative ways to incorporate\\nleader development and communicate with your leaders. Let them know you are\\ndeliberately developing them and everything they do is a developmental opportunity\u2014\\ntake advantage of it\u2014and grow as a Soldier and leader.\u201d\\nVisualize\\n5-14. Several sources inform decisions about setting the desired future end states for leader development.\\nPhilosophically, the team can examine the Army Campaign Plan and the intent in higher and sister\\norganization\u2019s development programs. The most important and enduring outcomes are stated in a vision or\\nintent statement, depending on the commander\u2019spreference.\\n5-15. An organizational development program establishes the goals for specific end states. Each leader\\ndevelopment program has four mutually supporting purposes. Each organization leader has a designated\\nresponsibility to accomplish the mission, improve the organization, prepare personnel to perform current\\nduties, and develop leaders for future responsibilities and other assignments. Different from unit training\\nplans, the leader development programaddresses long-term outcomes for individuals and the organization.\\n5-16. Outcomes should address at least these four areas (see table 5-2). Planning and executing the leader\\ndevelopment program is an organizational leader\u2019s responsibility. The vision or intent helps to focus and\\nsynchronize leader development actions across the organization to achieve the greatest effects.\\nTable 5-2.

He already said we can fight one rank up for taskings and that should help\\nfree up some leaders.\u201d\\nSFC Jefferies: \u201cThat will help a little but that doesn\u2019t solve the issue of the platoons\\nbeing ready for collective training. They just need more time together, and we don\u2019t\\nhave that.\u201d\\n1SG Diaz: \u201cWhat if we stopped pulling from across the company for taskings and\\ninstead put whole teams on them together? This would give team building time without\\nadding anything to the calendar.

From considering the learning enablers and developmental opportunities,the leader team creates a plan\\nfor scheduling events. The schedule assists those leading and supporting the execution. The schedule\\nmaintains reasonable activities and direction of emphasis to help ensure quality. Some events are required,\\nsuch as performance evaluations and professional growth counseling, and the plan\u2019s emphasis triggers other\\nactivities. The plan shouldencourage a mindset where leaders take the initiative to incorporate development\\ninto daily activities. Such activities include raising questions in an AAR about what leaders learned about\\nleadership or asking leaders what self-development they are doing.\\n5-21. The leader decides the best method to describe the leader development program, such as annual\\nconcept, quarterly concept with specific events, or theme based. The plan needs synchronize with the overall\\nunit schedule considering the training calendar, significant higher headquarters\u2019events that need support,and\\nother significant events.\\nExecute\\n5-22. Once completed, the leaders distribute the plan throughout the unit to direct program preparation and\\nexecution.Depending on the echelon, the leaders review subordinate unit leader developmentprograms.The\\nleader team sets, directs, and leads the organizational goals, shaping the conditions for individual\\ndevelopment. Individual development is based on the interests and the effort of individuals who develop\\nothers and themselves. It is up to each individual to learn, grow, and develop as an Army professional. An\\nIDP is a personal development plan. It is important that individuals and their raters work together to develop\\nan IDP. Executing the leader development program can become a regularly reported item in reviews, situation\\nreports, and training briefs.\\n5-23. Leaders must ensure the plan affects development positively. The plan is a way to emphasize\\ndevelopment and desired outcomes for individuals and for units. Leaders develop the plan with an intent to\\nsee it through. Reviewed, assessed, and updated periodically, the plan is a living document. Leaders commit\\nto creating an open learning environment where development becomes second nature, like when leaders\\nintegrate leader development into daily administrative and training events, as well as deployments.\\nAssess\\n5-24. Good units use various and distinct methods to continually assess leader and leader development\\nstrength and weaknesses.The leader team needs to ensure individual development stays the main effort and\\nthat the focus does not become the plan or running events. The documented plan is either an enabler or a\\ndetractor to successfully executing and achieving the desired outcomes depending on the degree of initiative.\\n5-25. Leaders assess implementation and execution against the established vision and end states. Just as\\nleadership assessments help set goals for the unit leader development program, assessing the program\\nimplementation and execution providesuseful information on how well the end states are being achieved and\\nareas for adjustment. The leader team should monitor whether the vision and end states areadequate or need\\nimprovement (see Section IV in chapter 2).\\n5-26. Leaders must conduct required development activitiessuch as performance evaluations, professional\\ngrowth counseling, IDPs, and command climate surveys. A leader\u2019s assessment in developing others can\\noccur through reviewing how leaders used formal, semi-formal, and informal activities in the program. The\\nleadership requirements model establishes the expectations for these functions and performance evaluations\\nhave provided the mechanism for checking. Multi-source assessments provide personal feedback to the leader\\non what they have done to establish a positive climate, engage in developing others, and steward the\\nprofession. The multi-source feedback provides an opportunity for leaders to address and improve their\\napproaches before evaluation.\\n5-27. Leader development is a holistic process that occurs every day aligning training, education, and\\nexperience to prepare leaders to improve. Development is critical to all cohorts\u2014enlisted, officer, and\\ncivilian\u2014the Army\u2019s future leaders source.

Some options include\u2014\\n(cid:122) Professional reading programs.\\n(cid:122) Professional writing programs.\\n(cid:122) Staff rides, historical tours, and terrain walks.\\nProfessional Reading Programs\\n5-29. Organizations and individuals can implement professional reading programs; many materials are\\navailable to supporttopic determination, such as the U.S. Army Chief of Staff\u2019s Professional Reading list or\\nthe U.S. Army Center of Military History Recommended Professional Reading List. Reading\\nrecommendations and book reviews from military journals, online discussion forums, podcasts, and social\\nmedia provide options for inclusion into unit or personal reading programs.Determining the frequency, such\\nas monthly or quarterly, depends on organizational missions, but the unit must allocate and protect time for\\neffective implementation. Professional reading programs can include a mix of journal articles, professional\\npapers, graphic novels, or military professional blog posts. Mixing sources enables leaders to share new ideas,\\nwriting styles, and emerging authors.\\nSuccessful reading programs depend on how they are structured\u2014what readings are chosen and\\nwhat purpose is integrated into the program. To encourage tactics, then select readings on\\noperational tactics. To develop skills for which interesting readings do not exist, then design\\nquestions that trigger reflection about engaging material. For example, to stimulate critical\\nthinking assign questions about the materials that require applying lessons to other situations and\\nconsidering underlying assumptions and alternative courses of action.\\nProfessional Writing Programs\\n5-30. Army leaders consider how they can contribute to the body of thought in their fields of expertise by\\nresearching and writing about topics that interest them. By writing and publishing papers, they can advance\\ntheir profession, mastery of their discipline, and writing skills. Scholarly paper writers study their topics in\\ndepth and in breadth. They take formal classes in research and in writing so they can master appropriate\\nstandards. They use appropriate writing processes. Before submitting papers to professional or academic\\njournals, they ensure their submissions meet the publications\u2019 requirements. In addition, the unit security\\noffice should screen items for publication to prevent classified information spillage. Writers scrupulously\\nadhere to intellectual property rights rules and shun plagiarism.\\n5-31. For leaders, a developmental writing program serves as a significant complementary companion to a\\nprofessional reading program and may lead to publication in scholarly journals. Length may vary based on\\nthe requirement. Some ideas for professional writing include:\\n(cid:122) Leadership philosophy\u2014an opportunity to discuss expectations, what is important, and what is\\nnon-negotiable.\\n(cid:122) Personal experiences:\\n(cid:131) Significant experience, whether good or bad, and its personal effect including lessons learned.\\n(cid:131) Routine experiences, describing how you handle them and possible improvements for\\nconsideration.\\n(cid:122) Historical person or event related to the branch, regimental affiliation, or organization.\\n(cid:122) Opinion piece explaining changes affecting your branch through a particular person, policy, or\\nequipment.\\n(cid:122) Book or movie reviews providing a detailed analysis of published or broadcast material for an\\nonline or professional journal.\\n(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21) FM 6-22 5-9Chapter 5\\nConsiderations for Professional Reading\\nReading programs foster study by making the reading relevant, providing a purpose,\\nand following up.

A staff ride is a historical campaign or battle study that usually includes deep preliminary study, an\\nextensive site visit, and opportunities to dissect and integrate lessons learned throughout the event. A\\ncomponent of this detailed study is a terrain analysis and the terrain\u2019s effect upon the battle or campaign.\\nSeeing the location provides context to leader decisions and insight into the choices leaders made.\\n5-33. Staff ride handbooks and atlases enable organizations to conduct staff rides, often with assistance from\\nthe Army University Pressor Center for Military History. Occasionally, units develop their own staff rides\\nand share products with other organizations. Virtual staff ridesfollow the same methodology as a live staff\\nride but provide a detailed terrain replication based upon satellite imagery, digital terrain, or three-\\ndimensional models to immerse participants in the virtual terrain and provide a realistic battlefield vision.\\n5-34. Historical battlefield tours or museum visits can provide opportunities to visualize leadership and\\nhistorical lessons by interacting with material items or physical terrain, but without the detailed study\\nassociated with a staff ride. Battlefield tours are typically brief and may include facilitated instruction from\\n5-10 FM 6-22 (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:49)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:21)Program Development\\na guide.

Developing a set of formal and informal indicators that accurately assess the health of unit leader\\ndevelopment in the organization is essential. Leaders use locally developed indicators to develop a leader\\ndevelopment scorecard (see figure 5-6). Indicators may be different for different unit types, such as\\noperational vice institutional. Employing a red/amber/green status suggests indicators requiring further\\ninvestigation, which may or may not relate directly to unit leader development efforts. The purpose is to\\nidentify trends over time and not react adversely to an indicator\u2019s single occurrence.\\nAdd locally developed leader development indicators to the unit training brief for subordinate\\nunits to track and report on like other key unit systems (such as training, maintenance, or budget).\\nRefine the measures to those that accurately indicate leader development health.\\nFigure 5-6.

(Ceremonies\\nare formations\u2014the arrangement of elements of a unit in a prescribed manner\u2014and movements in\\nwhich a number of troops execute movements in unison and with precision just as in drill; however,\\ntheir primary value is to render honors, preserve traditions, and stimulate esprit de corps.) It includes\\nmethods of instructing drill (movements by which a unit or individuals are moved in a uniform manner\\nfrom one formation to another, or from one place to another, with movements executed in unison and\\nwith precision), teaching techniques, individual and unit drill, manual of arms for Infantry weapons, and\\nvarious other aspects of basic drill instruction.\\nThe principal audience for TC 3-21.5 is all members of the profession of arms. Commanders\u2014the Soldiers\\nin charge\u2014and staffs of Army headquarters serving as joint task force or multinational headquarters should\\nalso refer to applicable joint or multinational doctrine concerning the range of military operations and joint\\nor multinational forces. Trainers and educators throughout the Army will also use this publication. Since all\\nsituations or eventualities pertaining to drill and ceremonies cannot be foreseen, commanders may find it\\nnecessary to adjust the procedures to local conditions. However, with the view toward maintaining\\nconsistency throughout the Army, the procedures prescribed herein should be followed as closely as possible.\\nPersonnel preparing to give drill instruction must be thoroughly familiar with chapters 3 through 7 before\\nattempting to teach material in chapters 8 and 9.\\nFor ease in distinguishing a preparatory command from a command of execution, the commands of execution\\nappear in BOLD CAP letters and preparatory commands appear in Bold Italic letters.

If anyone of you doesn\u2019t mean\\nbusiness let him say so now. An hour from now will be too late to back out. Once in,\\nyou\u2019ve got to see it through. You\u2019ve got to perform without flinching whatever duty is\\nassigned you, regardless of the difficulty or the danger attending it. If it is garrison duty,\\nyou must attend to it. If it is meeting fever, you must be willing. If it is the closest kind\\nof fighting, anxious for it. You must know how to ride, how to shoot, how to live in the\\nopen. Absolute obedience to every command is your first lesson. No matter what\\ncomes you mustn\u2019t squeal. Think it over\u2014all of you. If man wishes to withdraw he will\\nbe gladly excused, for others are ready to take his place.\u201d\\nTheodore Roosevelt, Remarks to Recruits, 1898\\nChapter 1\\nIntroduction\\nThe purpose of drill is to enable commanders or noncommissioned officers (NCOs) to\\nmove their unit from one place to another in an orderly manner, to aid in disciplinary\\ntraining by instilling habits of precision and response to the leader\u2019s orders, and to\\nprovide for the development of all Soldiers in the practice of commanding troops.\\nSECTION I \u2013 HISTORY\\n1-1. Military history reveals that armies throughout the world participated in some form of drill. The\\nprimary value of drill, historically, is to prepare troops for battle. For the most part, the drill procedures\\npracticed are identical to the tactical maneuvers employed on the battlefield. Drill enables commanders to\\nquickly move their forces from one point to another, mass their forces into a battle formation that affords\\nmaximum firepower, and maneuver those forces as the situation develops.\\n1-2. In 1775, when this country was striving for independence and existence, the Nation\u2019s leaders were\\nconfronted with the problem of not only establishing a government but also of organizing an Army that was\\nalready engaged in war. From the \u201cshot heard around the world,\u201d on 19 April 1775, until Valley Forge in\\n1778, Revolutionary forces were little more than a group of civilians fighting Indian-style against\\nwell-trained, highly disciplined British Redcoats. For three years, General George Washington\u2019s troops had\\nendured many hardships\u2014lack of funds, rations, clothing, and equipment. They had also suffered numerous\\nlosses to the superior British forces. These hardships and losses mostly stemmed from the lack of a military\\natmosphere in the country, resulting in the creation of an Army with little or no organization, control,\\ndiscipline, or teamwork.\\n1-3. Recognizing the crisis, General Washington, through Benjamin Franklin, the American ambassador to\\nFrance, enlisted the aid of Prussian officer Baron Friedrich von Steuben. Upon his arrival at Valley Forge on\\n23 February 1778, von Steuben, a former staff officer for Frederick the Great, met an army of several\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 1-1Chapter 1\\nthousand wretched, half-starved men in rags. He commented that a European army could not be kept together\\nin such a state. To correct the conditions that prevailed, he set to work immediately and wrote drill movements\\nand regulations at night and taught them the following day to a model company of 120 men selected from\\nthe line.\\n1-4. Discipline became a part of military life for these selected individuals as they learned to respond to\\ncommand without hesitation. This new discipline instilled in them a sense of alertness, urgency, and attention\\nto detail. Their confidence in themselves and their weapon grew as each Soldier perfected the fifteen 1-second\\nmovements required to load and fire their musket. As the Americans mastered the art of drill, they began to\\nwork as a team and to develop pride in themselves and in their units.\\n1-5. Watching this model company drill, observers were amazed to see how quickly and orderly the troops\\ncould be massed and maneuvered into different battle formations. Officers observed that organization, chain\\nof command, and control were improved as each Soldier had a specific place and task within the formation.\\nLater, the members of the model company were distributed throughout the Army to teach drill. Through drill,\\nthey improved the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the Army.\\n1-6. To ensure continuity and uniformity, von Steuben, by then a major general and the Army Inspector\\nGeneral, wrote the first Army field manual in 1779, \u201cThe Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the\\nTroops of the United States,\u201d commonly referred to as the Blue Book. The drill procedures initiated at Valley\\nForge were not changed for 85 years, until the American Civil War, and many of the drill terms and\\nprocedures are still in effect today.\\n1-7. Drill commands are about the same as at the time of the War of 1812, except that then the officers and\\nNCOs began them by saying, \u201cTake care to face to the right, right, face.\u201d Also, during the American\\nrevolutionary period, troops marched at a cadence of 76 steps per minute instead of the current cadence of\\n120 steps. (Cadence is the uniform rhythm in which a movement is executed, or the number of steps or\\ncounts per minute at which a movement is executed. Drill movements are normally executed at the\\ncadence of quick time or double-time. Quick time is the cadence of 120 counts or steps per minute;\\ndouble-time is the cadence of 180 counts or steps per minute.) Then units performed precise movement\\non the battlefield, and the Army that could best perform them was often able to get behind the enemy, or on\\ntheir flank, beating them. Speed ruined the winning exactness. Also, firearms shot neither far nor accurately\\nin 1776, so troop formations could take more time to approach the enemy.\\n1-8. As armament and weaponry improved, drill had to adapt to new tactical concepts. Although the\\nprocedures taught in drill today are not normally employed on the battlefield, the objectives accomplished\\nby drill\u2014professionalism, teamwork, confidence, pride, alertness, attention to detail, esprit de corps, and\\ndiscipline\u2014are just as important to the modern Army as they were to the Continental Army.\\nSECTION II \u2013 MILITARY MUSIC\\n1-9. Military music has been an integral part of the military since the U.S. Army was created. Drummers\\nhave provided beats to help with military drill. Bugles have been used on the battlefield to signal various\\nevents. Military musicians have been providing ceremonial music and performing in concerts to boost morale\\nsince the Revolutionary War. Cadence is sung in the morning to motivate and captivate Soldiers during\\nphysical training while keeping the formation in step. There are popular Country and Service songs played\\nat military functions that tell a story and instill pride in the force such as songs like \u201cBlood on the Risers\u201d\\nand \u201cBallad of the Green Beret,\u201d as well as marches like The Stars and Stripes Forever.\\n1-10. The earliest surviving pictorial, sculptured, and written records show musical or quasi-musical\\ninstruments employed in connection with military activity for signaling during encampments, parades, and\\ncombat. Because the sounds were produced in the open air, the instruments tended to be brass and percussion.\\nOriental, Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and American Indian chronicles and pictorial remains show trumpets and\\ndrums of many varieties allied to Soldiers and battles.\\nNATIONAL AND MILITARY SERVICE MUSIC\\n1-11. Two of the most distinguished pieces of music in the Army are the national anthem and the official\\nArmy song. These two pieces of military music are played at almost every Army function and require Soldiers\\n1-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Introduction to Drill and Ceremony\\nto stand at attention and sing (as required with the playing of the Army song), or stand at attention and\\nsometimes render the hand salute (as required with the playing of the national anthem). These pieces of\\nmilitary music were written in turbulent times and have significant meaning to all Soldiers and most\\nU.S. citizens.\\nNATIONAL ANTHEM\\n1-12. Our national anthem officially became \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d by law on 3 March 1931, in\\nSection 301, Title 36, U.S Code. The national anthem was written from an inspirational event witnessed by\\nthe songwriter, Francis Scott Key, as the British Royal Navy conducted a 25-hour bombardment on Fort\\nMcHenry. Francis Scott Key observed \u201cOld Glory\u201d still waving at the Fort after the Royal Navy was\\nunsuccessful in destroying it.\\nOFFICIAL ARMY SONG\\n1-13. The official Army song, \u201cThe Army Goes Rolling Along,\u201d was formally dedicated by the Secretary of\\nthe Army on Veterans Day, 11 November 1956, and was officially announced on 12 December 1957 (see\\nAR 220-90). In addition to standing at Attention during the playing of the official Army song, Army personnel\\nare required to sing the lyrics.\\nNote. Although there is no Department of Defense (DOD) directive\u2014no oral order given by a\\ncommander to direct or cause a subordinate leader or lead element to take action\u2014in this\\nregard, commanders, officers, and personnel from other military branches can encourage the\\ntribute to the Army by standing at Attention when the band plays \u201cThe Army Goes Rolling Along.\u201d\\nArmy personnel will stand at Attention during the playing of official songs of other branches of\\nService.\\nBUGLE CALLS\\n1-14. Bugle calls are used in U.S. military service as the result of the Continental Army\u2019s contact with\\nEuropean Soldiers and armies during the revolutionary period. After the American Revolution, many of the\\nFrench and English bugle calls and drum beats were adopted by the U.S. Army. Bugle calls are musical\\nsignals which announce scheduled and nonscheduled events on Army military bases. Appendix I, (table I-1\\non pages I-9 through I-11) gives detailed instruction of courtesies required to be rendered during bugle calls\\nplayed on military installations. See TC 1-19.10 for a full list and description of all the Army bugle calls.\\nThere are five classes of bugle calls: warning calls, formation calls, alarm calls, service calls, and ceremonial\\ncalls. Some of the most popular and significant bugle calls are\u2014\\n\\uf06c ATTENTION. This is taken from the British \u201cAlarm,\u201d at which call the troops turned out under\\narms. Attention is a parade bugle call letting Soldiers know that they are going to be called to the\\nPosition of Attention.\\n\\uf06c ADJUTANT\u2019S CALL. The adjutant\u2019s call indicates that the adjutant is about to form the guard,\\nbattalion, or regiment.\\n\\uf06c FIRST CALL. First call is the bugle call that signals to the troops as a warning that personnel will\\nprepare to assemble for a formation. This bugle call lets Soldiers know to move to the designated\\nformation area.\\n\\uf06c REVEILLE. Reveille is the bugle call played to signal the troops to awaken for morning roll call\\nand coincides with the raising of the national Color.\\n\\uf06c MESS CALL. The mess call is the bugle call that signals mealtime.\\n\\uf06c RETREAT. Retreat is the ceremony that pays honors to the national flag when it is lowered in the\\nevening.\\n\\uf06c TO THE COLOR. The old Cavalry call, \u201cTo the Standard,\u201d in use from about 1835, was replaced\\nby the present call of \u201cTo the Color.\u201d This bugle call is played immediately after the playing of\\nretreat.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 1-3Chapter 1\\n\\uf06c TATTOO. Tattoo is a popular bugle call that is played later in the evening prior to \u201cTaps\u201d and\\nsignals to Soldiers that all loud talking and other disturbances must be discontinued within\\n15 minutes.\\n\\uf06c \u201cTAPS.\u201d \u201cTaps\u201d is played on some military installations late in the evening as it signals \u201clights\\nout\u201d (extinguish all unauthorized lights). \u201cTaps\u201d was adapted by Union General Daniel Butterfield\\nfor his brigade back in July of 1862. \u201cTaps\u201d is also played at military funerals and is known to be\\none of the military\u2019s most recognizable and emotional bugle call.\\n\\uf06c SOUND OFF. Although technically not a bugle call, the \u201cSound Off\u201d performed by the band in\\nceremonies is derived from the tradition of using bugles to signal and rally troops. The band, in\\nplace, plays \u201cSound Off\u201d (three chords). It then moves forward and, changing direction while\\nplaying a stirring march, troops the line and marches past the Soldiers in formation, then returns\\nto its post\u2014the correct place for an officer or NCO to stand in a prescribed formation. Upon\\nhalting, the band again plays three chords. Sound Off is a parade bugle call.\\n1-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Chapter 2\\nDrill Instructions\\n\u201cTroops who march in an irregular and disorderly manner are always in great danger\\nof being defeated.\u201d\\nVegetius: De Re Militari: A.D. 378\\nSECTION I \u2013 INSTRUCTIONAL METHODS\\nThe progress made by individuals and units in precise and unified action in drill is determined by the\\nfollowing:\\n\\uf06c The methods of instruction and the thoroughness of the instructor.\\n\\uf06c The organization of Soldiers into units of the most effective instructional size.\\nThe three methods of instruction used to teach drill to Soldiers are: step by step, talk-through, and by\\nthe numbers. The character of the movement being taught will indicate the most effective method to use. As\\na rule, marching movements are taught using the step-by-step method. Movements that require numerous or\\nsimultaneous actions by an individual or unit are best taught using the talk-through method. Movements that\\nhave two or more counts are taught using the by-the-numbers method.\\nTo ensure that a Soldier develops satisfactory proficiency during the time allotted and to ensure a\\ncomplete and consistent presentation by the drill instructor, each movement, regardless of the method used,\\nshould be presented using three teaching stages\u2014\\n\\uf06c Explanation.\\n\\uf06c Demonstration.\\n\\uf06c Practice.\\nEXPLANATION\\nIn the explanation stage, the instructor must\u2014\\n\\uf06c Give the name of the movement.\\n\\uf06c Give the practical use for the movement.\\n\\uf06c Give the command(s) for the movement and explain its elements: the preparatory command and\\nthe command of execution.\\n\\uf06c Also discuss the command(s) necessary to terminate the movement. (Supplementary commands\\nare discussed where appropriate in the explanations.)\\nThis is how an instructor teaches a marching movement using the first teaching stage (explanation):\\n\u201cPlatoon, ATTENTION. AT EASE. The next movement (position), which I will name, explain, and have\\ndemonstrated, and which you will conduct practical work on, is the 30-Inch Step From the Halt. This\\nmovement is used to march an element from point A to point B in a uniform manner. The command to\\nexecute this movement is Forward, MARCH. This is a two-part command: Forward is the preparatory\\ncommand, and MARCH is the command of execution. The command to terminate this movement is HALT.\\nHalt is also a two-part command when preceded by a preparatory command such as Squad or Platoon. I will\\nuse Demonstrator as the preparatory command and HALT as the command of execution. When given, these\\ncommands are as follows: Forward, MARCH; Demonstrator, HALT.\u201d\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 2-1Chapter 2\\nDEMONSTRATION\\nIn the demonstration stage, the instructor may use the step-by-step, talk-through, or by-the-numbers\\nmethods of instruction. The instructor may demonstrate the movement themselves, modifying their position\\nwhen necessary to maintain eye-to-eye contact with personnel being instructed.\\nSTEP-BY-STEP METHOD OF INSTRUCTION\\nIn the step-by-step method of instruction, the explanation and demonstration are combined. The\\nmovements are taught one step at a time.\\nNote. The letters P, I, C, or A that have been added to the end of certain paragraphs to help the\\nreader understand the five-step process used in all marching movements comprise a mnemonic\\nknown as the PICAA effect. Put simply, the preparatory command, the command of execution,\\nand the action step\u2014executing the movement\u2014are all given or executed when the same foot\\nstrikes the marching surface. The intermediate step and additional step are executed with the other\\nfoot.\\nThe instructor explains that on the command of execution, the demonstrator takes only one step and\\nthen stops in position until the command Ready, STEP (for the next step) is given. While the demonstrator\\nis stopped in position, the instructor makes on-the-spot corrections and explains the actions for the next step.\\nThe instructor then has the demonstrator execute the movement at normal cadence.\\nThis is how an instructor teaches the demonstration stage when using the step-by-step method of\\ninstruction:\\n\\uf06c \u201cDemonstrator, POST. I will use the step-by-step method of instruction. On the preparatory\\ncommand Forward of Forward, MARCH, without noticeable movement, shift the weight of the\\nbody onto the right foot. Forward.\u201d\\n\\uf06c \u201cOn the command of execution MARCH of Forward, MARCH, step forward 30 inches with the\\nleft foot. The head, eyes, and body remain as in the Position of Attention. The arms swing in\\nnatural motion, without exaggeration and without bending the elbows, about 9 inches straight to\\nthe front and 6 inches straight to the rear of the trouser seams. The fingers and thumbs are curled\\nas in the Position of Attention, just barely clearing the trousers. MARCH.\u201d (Front is defined as\\nthe space from side to side of a formation, including the right and left elements.)\\n\\uf06c \u201cOn the command of execution STEP of Ready, STEP, execute a 30-inch step with the trail foot.\\nOnce again, ensure that the head, eyes, and body remain as in the Position of Attention, and that\\nthe arms swing naturally, without exaggeration, and without bending the elbows, about 9 inches\\nstraight to the front and 6 inches straight to the rear of the trouser seams. The fingers and thumbs\\nare curled, as in the Position of Attention, barely clearing the trousers. Ready, STEP. Notice that\\nthere are two steps explained: one from the Halt and one while marching.\u201d\\n\\uf06c \u201cThe command to terminate this movement is HALT. The preparatory command Demonstrator\\nof Demonstrator, HALT, may be given as either foot strikes the marching surface. However, the\\ncommand of execution HALT of Demonstrator, HALT, must be given the next time that same\\nfoot strikes the marching surface. The Halt is executed in two counts.\u201d\\n\\uf06c \u201cOn the command of execution STEP of Ready, STEP, execute a 30-inch step with the trail foot.\\nWhen that foot strikes the marching surface, the demonstrator will receive the preparatory\\ncommand Demonstrator of Demonstrator, HALT.

Each movement is orally described. In this method, the explanation and\\naction by individuals is executed as the instructor tells the demonstrators what they want them to do and how\\nto do it. The demonstrators execute the movement as the instructor describes it; then, the instructor has the\\ndemonstrators execute the movement at normal cadence.\\nThis is how an instructor teaches the demonstration stage when using the talk-through method of\\ninstruction:\\n\\uf06c \u201cDemonstrator, POST.

You will be my assistant instructor. FALL OUT.\u201d (Notice that\\nthere is no Ready, ONE command.)\\nPRACTICE\\nThe practice stage is executed in the same manner as the demonstration stage except that the instructor\\nuses the proper designator for the size of their element. However, the instructor does not have their element\\nexecute the movement at normal cadence until their element has shown a satisfactory degree of proficiency\\nexecuting the movement using the selected method of instruction.\\nSECTION II \u2013 INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUES\\nBasic drill instruction includes U, line, circular, and extended rectangular formations. Basic drill\\ninstruction also includes stationary and moving cadence counts and dedicated instruction to units and\\nindividuals.\\nFORMATIONS\\nInstructors could use one of the four formation types when providing instructions to their formation\\nwhile conducting drill. In all phases of drill, instruction and practical work can best be presented by using\\nthe U-formation or line formation. As a rule, stationary movements are taught using the U-formation;\\nmarching movements, including squad, platoon, and company drills, are best taught from the line formation.\\nInstructors also have the option to use the extended rectangular and circular formations. Soldiers should be\\ntaught in the smallest formation possible to ensure individual attention; however, squad drill, whenever\\n2-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Drill Instructions\\npossible, should be taught to squad-size units, platoon drill to platoon-size units, and company drill to\\ncompany-size units.\\nU-FORMATION\\nThe U-formation is formed by the instructor commanding Count, OFF. On the command of execution\\nOFF of Count, OFF, all personnel, except the right flank personnel, turn their heads and eyes to the right\\nand the right flank personnel count off with \u201cONE.\u201d After the right flank Soldiers have counted their number,\\nthe Soldiers to their left count off with the next higher number and simultaneously turn their heads and eyes\\nto the front. All other members of the formation count off in the same manner until the entire formation has\\ncounted off. The instructor then commands First and second squads, FALL OUT.\\nOn the command of execution FALL OUT, the first squad faces to the right, and the second squad\\nfaces to the left. After the squads have faced, the instructor commands U-formation, FALL IN.\\nOn the command of execution FALL IN, the following actions happen simultaneously:\\n\\uf06c The first squad faces right, executes a Column Left, and takes one more step than the highest\\nnumber counted when the formation counted off; halts, and faces to the left without command.\\n\\uf06c The second squad faces left, marches forward until the lead Soldier clears the last vacated position\\nof the first squad, and then executes a Column Right, taking three more steps than the highest\\nnumber counted when the formation counted off; halts, and faces to the right without command.\\n\\uf06c The third squad stands fast, and the fourth squad executes one 15-Inch Step to the Left. The\\ninstructor ensures that the first and second squads are one step in front of and one step outside the\\nflanks of the third squad before commanding AT EASE beginning the instruction.\\nTo re-form the platoon in a line formation, the commands are: FALL OUT (pause); FALL IN. The\\nmembers of the platoon execute in the reverse manner as prescribed above, taking the same number of steps.\\nLINE FORMATION\\nWhen instructing using the line formation at normal interval, it is recommended that the first rank\\nkneels (right knee), second rank executes one 15-Inch Step to the Left and kneels (left knee), third rank stands\\nfast, and the fourth rank takes one 15-Inch Step to the Left. (Rank is a line that is one element in-depth.)\\nThe instructor adjusts any additional ranks as necessary to ensure they are uncovered. This formation can\\nquickly be formed by commanding Instructional Formation, MARCH. To re-form the unit into a line\\nformation, the command is FALL IN. The members of the platoon execute in the reverse manner as\\nprescribed above. (Normal interval is the lateral space between Soldiers, measured from right to left by\\nthe Soldier on the right holding their left arm shoulder high, fingers and thumb extended and joined,\\nwith the tip of their middle finger touching the right shoulder of the Soldier to their left.)\\nEXTENDED RECTANGULAR FORMATION\\nThe instructor may find using the extended rectangular formation more suitable for use:\\n\\uf06c To form the extended rectangular formation, the instructor commands Extend to the left,\\nMARCH. All right flank Soldiers stand fast with only their left arm extended sideward with palm\\ndown, fingers and thumbs extended and joined. All other Soldiers turn to the left and double-time\\nforward. After taking a sufficient number of steps, the Soldiers stop, face to the front, and extend\\nboth arms sideward with palms down, with fingers and thumbs extended and joined. The distance\\nbetween the fingertips of one Soldier to another is 12 inches, dress is to the right and cover to the\\nfront. The remainder of the body is in the Position of Attention. (Distance is defined as the space\\nbetween elements when the elements are one behind the other. Between units, it varies with\\nthe size of the formation; between individuals, it is an arm\u2019s length to the front plus 6 inches,\\nor about 36 inches, measured from the chest of one Soldier to the back of the Soldier\\nimmediately to their front.\\n\\uf06c The instructor then commands Arms downward, MOVE. The Soldiers lower their arms sharply\\nto the sides as in the Position of Attention.\\n\\uf06c The instructor then commands Left, Face. All Soldiers execute a left face.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 2-5Chapter 2\\n\\uf06c The instructor then commands Extend to the left, MARCH. All Soldiers execute as previously\\ndescribed.\\n\\uf06c The instructor then commands Arms downward, MOVE. All Soldiers execute as previously\\ndescribed.\\n\\uf06c The instructor then commands Right, FACE. All Soldiers execute a right face.\\n\\uf06c The instructor then commands From front to rear, COUNT OFF. (COUNT OFF is the entire\\ncommand of execution.) Each member of the first rank turns their head and eyes to the right and\\ncounts off with ONE, then faces back to the front. The remaining ranks execute in the same\\nmanner as the first rank, counting off in the same manner as the first rank until the entire formation\\nhas counted off. The members of the last (rear) rank do not turn their heads and eyes.\\n\\uf06c The instructor then commands Even numbers to the left, UNCOVER. All even-numbered\\nSoldiers jump squarely in the center of the interval, resuming the Position of Attention. The\\nformation is now prepared for instruction.\\n\\uf06c To return the formation to the original configuration, the instructor commands Assemble to the\\nright, MARCH. All Soldiers double-time to their original position in formation.\\nCIRCULAR FORMATION\\nThe instructor may find the circular formation more suitable for training:\\n\\uf06c The instructor positions themselves in front of the lead Soldier in the lead squad, looks over their\\nright shoulder, and commands Circle formation, FOLLOW ME. The instructor double-times in\\na circle large enough for the formation and moves to the center of the circle. The members of the\\nlead squad follow at an arm\u2019s length plus 6 inches (approximately 40 inches total). The squad\\nleaders of the following squads begin double-timing at the correct distance from the last Soldier\\nin the preceding squad without command. After the entire formation is in a circle, the instructor\\ncomes to the Position of Attention and commands Quick time, MARCH. The Soldiers begin\\nmarching normally. The instructor then gives directives to individual Soldiers and corrects the\\ndistance between them until each member is at approximately double arm interval.\\n\\uf06c The instructor then commands the formation to Halt using the appropriate preparatory command.\\n\\uf06c The instructor then commands Left, FACE. All personnel face toward the instructor. The\\nformation is now ready for instruction.\\n\\uf06c To return the formation to its original configuration, the instructor commands the formation to\\nattention and commands FALL OUT, then FALL IN. On the command FALL IN, all Soldiers\\nreturn to their original position in formation.\\nNote. When conditions do not warrant this formation, Soldiers may be directed to remain standing\\nand to uncover. To assemble the unit, the command FALL IN is given.\\nINSTRUCTORS\\nWhen acting as instructors or assistant instructors, officers and NCOs go wherever they are needed.\\nThey correct mistakes and ensure steadiness and proper performance in ranks. When Soldiers shows that they\\nare unable to execute the proper movements or assume the proper position, the instructor may physically\\nassist them.\\nCADENCE COUNTING\\nTo enable Soldiers to learn or maintain cadence and develop rhythm, the instructor should have them\\ncount cadence while marching.\\nTo count cadence while marching at quick time, the instructor gives the preparatory command, Count\\nCadence, as the left foot strikes the marching surface, and the command of execution, COUNT, the next\\ntime the left foot strikes the marching surface. The Soldier begins to count the next time the left foot strikes\\nthe marching surface and counts as each foot strikes the marching surface\u2014ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR;\\n2-6 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Drill Instructions\\nONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR. To count cadence while double-timing, the procedures are basically the same,\\nexcept the Soldier only counts each time the left foot strikes the marching surface. To maintain cadence when\\nmarching, Soldiers will be allowed to sing, or a drummer\u2019s beat may provide cadence.\\nFor stationary movements of two or more counts, the instructor commands In Cadence, Right, FACE.\\nSoldiers simultaneously execute the first count of the movement on the command of execution and sounds\\noff, ONE; as they execute the second count, they sound off, TWO.\\nNote. To halt execution of movements in cadence, the instructor commands Without Cadence,\\nand resumes normal drill methods. For example, Without Cadence, MARCH when marching at\\nCount Cadence or Without Cadence, Left, FACE for stationary movements.\\nAs Soldiers begin to master the art of drill, instructors encourage a spirit of competition among\\nindividuals and between units. Although repetition is necessary when teaching drill, instructors use\\ncompetitive drill exercises to ensure that drill does not become boring or monotonous.\\nMass commands are used to develop confidence and promote enthusiasm. They are effective in\\ndeveloping a command voice when instructing a leadership course. Procedures for using mass commands are\\ndiscussed in chapter 3.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 2-7This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 3\\nCommands and the Command Voice\\n\u201cThe spirit of discipline, as distinct from its outward and visible guises, is the result of\\nassociation with martial traditions and their living embodiment.\u201d\\nB. H. Liddell Hart, Thoughts on War, 1944\\nSECTION I \u2013 COMMANDS\\n3-1. A drill command is an oral order of a commander or leader. The precision with which a movement is\\nexecuted is affected by the way the command is given.\\nRULES\\n3-2. The following rules for giving commands apply to the commander when the unit drills as a separate\\nunit and not as part of a larger formation:\\n\\uf06c When at the Halt, the commander faces the troops when giving commands. On commands that set\\nthe unit in motion (marching from one point to another), the commander moves simultaneously\\nwith the unit to maintain correct position within the formation. (See chapter 4, paragraphs 4-7 and\\n4-27, for more information on facing in marching.)\\n\\uf06c When the commander is marching, without regard to the formation, the commander turns their\\nhead in the direction of the troops to give commands.\\n\\uf06c Exceptions to these rules occur during ceremonies, which are discussed in chapter 10.\\n\\uf06c When elements drill as part of a larger unit, the rules for supplementary commands apply (see\\nparagraph 3-6).\\n\\uf06c The commander gives the command AS YOU WERE to revoke a preparatory command that they\\nhave given. The command AS YOU WERE must be given before the command of execution.\\nThe commander cannot cancel the command of execution with AS YOU WERE. If an improper\\ncommand is not revoked, the personnel execute the movement in the best manner possible.\\nTWO-PART COMMANDS\\n3-3. Most drill commands have two parts: the preparatory command and the command of execution. Neither\\npart is a command by itself, but the parts are termed commands to simplify instruction. The commands Ready,\\nPort, ARMS, and Ready, Aim, FIRE, are considered two-part commands even though they contain two\\npreparatory commands. The following are the parts of the two-part commands:\\n\\uf06c Preparatory command. The preparatory command states the movement to be carried out and\\nmentally prepares the Soldier for its execution. In the command Forward, MARCH, the\\npreparatory command is Forward.\\n\\uf06c Command of execution. The command of execution tells when the movement is to be carried out.\\nIn Forward, MARCH, the command of execution is MARCH.\\n3-4. To change direction of a unit when marching, the preparatory command and command of execution\\nfor each movement are given so they begin and end on the foot in the direction of the turn: Right Flank,\\nMARCH is given as the right foot strikes the marching surface, and Left Flank, MARCH as the left foot\\nstrikes the marching surface. The interval between the preparatory command and the command of execution\\nis always one step or count. The preparatory command and command of execution are always given when\\nthe same foot strikes the marching surface.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 3-1Chapter 3\\nCOMBINED COMMANDS\\n3-5. In some commands, the preparatory command and the command of execution are combined; for\\nexample, FALL IN, AT EASE, and REST. These commands are given without inflection and at a uniformly\\nhigh pitch and loudness comparable to that for a normal command of execution.\\nSUPPLEMENTARY COMMANDS\\n3-6. Supplementary commands are verbal orders, given by a subordinate leader, that reinforce and\\ncomplement a commander\u2019s order. They ensure proper understanding and execution of a movement. They\\nextend to the lowest subordinate leader exercising control over an element affected by the command as a\\nseparate element within the same formation.\\n3-7. A supplementary command may be a preparatory command, a portion of a preparatory command, or a\\ntwo-part command. It is normally given between the preparatory command and the command of execution.\\nHowever, when a command requires an element of a unit to execute a movement different from other\\nelements within the same formation, or the same movement at a different time, subordinate leaders give their\\nsupplementary commands at the time prescribed by the procedures covering that particular movement.\\nExample:\\nThe platoon is in column formation, and the platoon leader commands Column of\\nTwos From the Left (pause), MARCH. The first and second squad leaders command\\nForward; the third and fourth squad leaders command STAND FAST. On the\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the first and second squads march forward. At the\\nappropriate time, the squad leader (third squad) nearest the moving element\\ncommands Column Half Left, MARCH (for both remaining squads). As the third and\\nfourth squad leaders reach the line of march, they automatically execute a Column\\nHalf Left and obtain normal distance behind the first and second squads.\\n3-8. Subordinate leaders give all supplementary commands over their right shoulder except when their\\ncommand is based on the actions of an element on their left or when the subordinate is to execute a Column\\nLeft (Half Left) or Left Flank. Giving commands over the left shoulder occurs when changing configuration\\nor a formation, such as forming a file (column that has a front of one element) or a column of fours and\\nre-forming. (See chapter 7, paragraph 7-13, for more information on forming a file and re-forming.)\\nExample:\\nThe platoon is in column formation and is going to form a file to the left. The left flank\\nsquad leader will give the supplementary command Column, LEFT over the left\\nshoulder, since the movement will be to the left. The other squad leaders will give the\\nsupplementary command STAND FAST over the left shoulder as their movement will\\nbe to the left and is based on an element to the left.\\nNote. When in formation at present arms and the preparatory command Order of Order, ARMS\\nis given, subordinate leaders terminate their salute before giving their supplementary command.\\n3-9. Supplementary commands are not given by a subordinate leader for the combined commands FALL\\nIN, AT EASE, REST or for mass drill when their element forms as part of a massed formation. However,\\nsupplementary commands are given when forming a mass or when forming a column from a mass.\\n3-10. Except for commands while in mass formation, platoon leaders give supplementary commands\\nfollowing all preparatory commands of the commander. When the preparatory command is Company, the\\n3-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Commands and the Command Voice\\nplatoon leaders immediately come to Attention and command Platoon. The company commander allows for\\nall supplementary commands before giving the command of execution.\\n3-11. When no direction is given, the response is understood to be Forward; when no rate of march is given,\\nthe response is Quick Time. Normally, when a direction or rate of march is included in the preparatory\\ncommand, only the direction or rate of march is given as a supplementary command.\\nDIRECTIVES\\n3-12. Directives are oral orders given by the commander that direct or cause a subordinate leader to act. The\\ncommander gives directives rather than commands when it is more appropriate for subordinate elements to\\nexecute a movement or perform a task as independent elements of the same formation:\\n\\uf06c TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR UNITS is the only directive on which a commander relinquishes\\ntheir command and on which salutes are exchanged.\\n\\uf06c Directives are given in sentence form and are normally prefaced by the terms HAVE YOUR\\nUNITS or BRING YOUR UNITS.\\nExample:\\nHAVE YOUR UNITS Open Ranks and Stack Arms; BRING YOUR UNITS to Present\\nArms.\\nSECTION II \u2013 THE COMMAND VOICE\\n3-13. A correctly delivered command will be understood by everyone in the unit. Correct commands have a\\ntone, cadence, and snap that demand willing, correct, and immediate response.\\nVOICE CONTROL\\n3-14. The loudness of a command is adjusted to the number of Soldiers in the unit. Normally, the commander\\nis to the front and center of the unit and speaks facing the unit so that their voice reaches everyone. The voice\\nmust have carrying power, but excessive exertion is unnecessary and harmful. A typical result of trying too\\nhard is the almost unconscious tightening of the neck muscles to force sound out. This produces strain,\\nhoarseness, sore throat, and worst of all, indistinct and jumbled sounds instead of clear commands. Ease of\\ngiving proper commands is achieved through good posture, proper breathing, correct adjustment of throat\\nand mouth muscles, and confidence.\\n3-15. The best posture for giving commands is the Position of Attention. Soldiers in formation notice the\\nposture of their leader: if the leaders\u2019 posture is unmilitary\u2014relaxed, slouched, stiff, or uneasy\u2014the\\nsubordinates will imitate it.\\n3-16. The most important muscle used in breathing is the diaphragm\u2014the large muscle that separates the\\nchest cavity from the abdominal cavity. The diaphragm automatically controls normal breathing and is used\\nto control the breath in giving commands. The throat, mouth, and nose act as amplifiers and help to give\\nfullness (resonance) and projection to the voice.\\nDISTINCTIVENESS\\n3-17. Distinctiveness depends on the correct use of the tongue, lips, and teeth, which form the separate\\nsounds of a word and group the sounds into syllables. Distinct commands are effective; indistinct commands\\ncause confusion. All commands can be pronounced correctly without loss of effect. Emphasize correct\\nenunciation (distinctiveness). To enunciate clearly, make full use of the lips, tongue, and lower jaw.\\n3-18. To develop the ability to give clear, distinct commands, practice giving commands slowly and\\ncarefully, prolonging the syllables. Then, gradually increase the rate of delivery to develop proper cadence,\\nstill enunciating each syllable distinctly.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 3-3Chapter 3\\nINFLECTION\\n3-19. Inflection is the rise and fall in pitch and the tone changes of the voice. Inflection is going to change\\nwhen giving preparatory command, command of execution, and combined commands.\\n3-20. The preparatory command is the command that indicates movement. Pronounce each preparatory\\ncommand with a rising inflection. The most desirable pitch when beginning a preparatory command is near\\nthe level of the natural speaking voice. A common fault made by beginners is to start the preparatory\\ncommand in a pitch so high that, after employing a rising inflection for the preparatory command, it is\\nimpossible to give the command of execution with clarity and without strain. A good rule to remember: begin\\na command near the natural pitch of the voice (see figure 3-1).\\n3-21. The command of execution is the command that indicates when a movement is to be executed. Give it\\nin a sharper tone and in a slightly higher pitch than the last syllable of the preparatory command. It must be\\ngiven with plenty of snap. The best way to develop a command voice is to practice.\\n3-22. In combined commands, such as FALL IN and FALL OUT, the preparatory command and command\\nof execution are combined. Give these commands without inflection and with the uniform high pitch and\\nloudness of a normal command of execution.\\nFigure 3-1. Diagram of a command\\nCADENCE\\n3-23. Cadence, in commands, means a uniform and rhythmic flow of words. The interval between commands\\nis uniform in length for any given troop unit. This is necessary so that everyone in the unit can understand\\nthe preparatory command and will know when to expect the command of execution.\\n3-24. For the squad or platoon in March, except when supplementary commands need to be given, the\\ninterval of time is that which allows one step (or count) between the preparatory command and the command\\nof execution. The same interval is used for commands given at the Halt. Longer commands, such as\\nRight flank, MARCH, must be started so that the preparatory command will end on the proper foot, and\\nleave a full count between the preparatory command and command of execution.\\n3-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Commands and the Command Voice\\n3-25. When supplementary commands are necessary, the commander should allow for one count between\\nthe preparatory command and the subordinate leader\u2019s supplementary command, and an additional count\\nafter the subordinate command but before the command of execution.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 3-5This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 4\\nIndividual Drill\\n\u201cMaintain discipline and caution above all things, and be on the alert to obey the\\nword of command.

The explanation of a movement that may be executed toward either flank is given in this\\nchapter for only one flank. To execute the movement toward the opposite flank, substitute left for\\nright or right for left in the explanation.\\nSECTION I \u2013 STATIONARY MOVEMENTS\\n4-1. This section contains most of the individual positions and stationary movements required in drill. These\\npositions and the correct execution of the movement, in every detail, should be learned before proceeding to\\nother drill movements.\\n4-2. Movements are initiated from the Position of Attention. However, some rest movements may be\\nexecuted from other rest positions.\\nPOSITION OF ATTENTION\\n4-3. Two commands can be used to put personnel at the Position of Attention:\\n\\uf06c FALL IN is used to assemble a formation or return it to its original configuration.\\n\\uf06c The two-part command for Attention is used for Soldiers at a rest position. Assume the Position\\nof Attention on the command FALL IN or the command Squad (Platoon), ATTENTION.\\n4-4. To assume this position, bring the heels together sharply on line, with the toes pointing out equally,\\nforming a 45-degree angle. Rest the weight of the body evenly on the heels and balls of both feet. Keep the\\nlegs straight without locking the knees. Hold the body erect with the hips level, chest lifted and arched, and\\nshoulders square. Keep the head erect and face straight to the front with the chin drawn in so alignment of\\nthe head and neck is vertical.\\n4-5. Let the arms hang straight without stiffness. Curl the fingers so that the tips of the thumbs are alongside\\nand touching the first joint of the forefingers. Keep the thumbs straight along the seams of the trouser leg\\nwith the first joint of the fingers touching the trousers (see figure 4-1 on page 4-2). Remain silent and do not\\nmove unless otherwise directed.\\nNote. This position is assumed by enlisted Soldiers when addressing officers, or when officers are\\naddressing officers of superior rank.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 4-1Chapter 4\\nFigure 4-1. Position of attention\\nREST POSITIONS AT THE HALT\\n4-6. Any of the positions of rest may be commanded and executed from the Position of Attention. The\\nfollowing are rest positions that could be given at the halt:\\n\\uf06c Parade Rest. Parade Rest is commanded only from the Position of Attention. The command for\\nthis movement is Parade, REST.\\n\\uf0a7 On the command of execution REST, move the left foot about 10 inches to the left of the\\nright foot. Keep the legs straight without locking the knees, resting the weight of the body\\nequally on the heels and balls of the feet.\\n\\uf0a7 Simultaneously, place the hands at the small of the back and centered on the belt. Keep the\\nfingers of both hands extended and joined, interlocking the thumbs so that the palm of the\\nright hand is outward (see figure 4-2).\\n4-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Individual Drill\\n\\uf0a7 Keep the head and eyes as in the Position of Attention. Remain silent and do not move unless\\notherwise directed. Stand at Ease, At Ease, and Rest may be executed from this position.\\nNote.

The command for this movement is Stand at, EASE. On the command of execution\\nEASE, execute Parade Rest, but turn the head and eyes directly toward the person in charge of\\nthe formation. At Ease or Rest may be executed from this position.\\n\\uf06c At Ease. The command for this movement is AT EASE. On the command AT EASE, Soldiers\\nmay move; however, they must remain standing and silent with their right foot in place. Soldiers\\nmay relax their arms with the thumbs interlaced. Rest may be executed from this position.\\n\\uf06c Rest. The command for this movement is REST. On the command REST, Soldiers may move,\\ntalk, or drink unless otherwise directed. They must remain standing with their right foot in place.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 4-3Chapter 4\\nAT EASE may be executed from this position to allow Soldiers to secure canteens, other\\nequipment, and so forth.\\nNote. On the preparatory command for Attention, immediately assume Parade Rest when at the\\nposition of Stand at Ease, At Ease, or Rest. If, for some reason, a subordinate element is already\\nat attention, the members of the element remain so and do not execute parade rest on the\\npreparatory command, nor does the subordinate leader give a supplementary command.\\nFACING AT THE HALT\\n4-7. There are five facing movements executed from the Position of Attention. They are Left (Right),\\nFACE, Half Left (Half Right), FACE, and About, FACE.\\nNote. Half Left (Half Right), FACE should only be used in situations when a 90-degree facing\\nmovement would not face an element in the desired direction (for example, for a stationary\\nelement to face the direction of the flag to render honors [reveille or retreat]).\\nFACING TO THE FLANK\\n4-8. Facing to the Flank is a two-count movement. The command is Left (Right), FACE:\\n\\uf06c On the command of execution FACE, slightly raise the right heel and left toe, and turn 90 degrees\\nto the left on the left heel, assisted by a slight pressure on the ball of the right foot. Keep the left\\nleg straight without stiffness and allow the right leg to bend naturally.\\n\\uf06c On count two, place the right foot beside the left foot, resuming the Position of Attention.

The Hand Salute is a one-count movement. The command is Present, ARMS. The Hand Salute may\\nbe executed while marching. When marching, only the Soldier in charge of the formation salutes and\\nacknowledges salutes. When double-timing, an individual Soldier must come to Quick Time before saluting.\\n4-11. When wearing headgear with a visor (with or without glasses), on the command of execution ARMS,\\nraise the right hand sharply, fingers and thumb extended and joined, palm facing down, and place the tip of\\nthe right forefinger on the rim of the visor slightly to the right of the right eye. The outer edge of the hand is\\nbarely canted downward so that neither the back of the hand nor the palm is clearly visible from the front.\\nThe hand and wrist are straight, the elbow inclined slightly forward, and the upper arm horizontal (see\\nfigure 4-5, box 1).\\n4-12. When wearing headgear without a visor (or uncovered) and wearing glasses, execute the Hand Salute\\nin the same manner as previously described in paragraph 4-11, except touch the tip of the right forefinger to\\nthat point on the glasses where the temple piece of the frame meets the right edge of the right brow (see\\nfigure 4-5, box 2).\\n4-13. When wearing headgear without a visor (or uncovered) and not wearing glasses, execute the Hand\\nSalute in the same manner as previously described in paragraph 4-10, except touch the tip of the right\\nforefinger to the forehead near and slightly to the right of the right eyebrow (see figure 4-5, box 3).\\n4-14. Order Arms from the Hand Salute is a one-count movement. The command is Order, ARMS. On the\\ncommand of execution ARMS, return the hand sharply to the side, resuming the Position of Attention.\\n4-15. When reporting or rendering courtesy to an individual, turn the head and eyes toward the person\\naddressed and simultaneously salute. In this situation, the actions are executed without command. The Salute\\nis initiated by the subordinate at the appropriate time (six paces) and terminated upon acknowledgment. (See\\nappendix A for more information on saluting.)\\nFigure 4-5. Hand salute\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 4-7Chapter 4\\nSECTION II \u2013 STEPS AND MARCHING\\n4-16. This section contains all the steps in marching of the individual Soldier. These steps should be learned\\nthoroughly before proceeding to unit drill.\\nBASIC MARCHING INFORMATION\\n4-17. This basic marching information pertains to all marching movements:\\n\\uf06c All marching movements executed from the Halt are initiated from the Position of Attention.\\n\\uf06c Except for Route Step March and At Ease March, all marching movements are executed while\\nmarching at Attention. Marching at Attention is the combination of the Position of Attention and\\nthe procedures for the prescribed step executed simultaneously.\\n\\uf06c When executed from the Halt, all steps except Right Step begin with the left foot.\\n\\uf06c For short-distance marching movements, the commander may designate the number of steps\\nforward, backward, or sideward by giving the appropriate command: One step to the right (left),\\nMARCH; or Two steps backward (forward), MARCH. On the command of execution MARCH,\\nstep off with the appropriate foot, and halt automatically after completing the number of steps\\ndesignated. Unless otherwise specified, when directed to execute steps forward, the steps will be\\n30-inch steps.\\n\\uf06c All marching movements are executed in the cadence of Quick Time (120 steps per minute) except\\nfor the 30-inch step, which may be executed in the cadence of 180 steps per minute on the\\ncommand Double Time, MARCH.\\n\\uf06c A step is the prescribed distance from one heel to the other heel of a marching Soldier.\\n\\uf06c All 15-inch steps are executed for a short distance only.\\nTHE 30-INCH STEP\\n4-18. To march with a 30-inch step from the Halt, the command is Forward, MARCH:\\n\\uf06c On the preparatory command Forward, shift the weight of the body to the right foot without\\nnoticeable movement. On the command of execution MARCH, step forward 30 inches with the\\nleft foot and continue marching with 30-inch steps, keeping the head and eyes fixed to the front.\\nThe arms swing in a natural motion, without exaggeration and without bending at the elbows,\\napproximately 9 inches straight to the front and 6 inches straight to the rear of the trouser seams.\\nKeep the fingers curled as in the Position of Attention so that the fingers just clear the trousers.\\n\\uf06c To Halt while marching, the command Squad (Platoon), HALT is given. The preparatory\\ncommand Squad (Platoon) is given as either foot strikes the marching surface as long as the\\ncommand of execution HALT is given the next time that same foot strikes the marching surface.\\nThe Halt is executed in two counts. After HALT is commanded, execute the additional step\\nrequired after the command of execution and then bring the trail foot alongside the lead foot,\\nassuming the Position of Attention and terminating the movement.\\nCHANGE STEP\\n4-19. This movement is executed automatically whenever Soldiers finds themselves out of step with all other\\nmembers of the formation. It is only executed while marching forward with a 30-inch step. To change step,\\nthe command Change Step, MARCH is given as the right foot strikes the marching surface. On the command\\nof execution MARCH, take one more step with the left foot, then, in one count, place the right toe near the\\nheel of the left foot and step off again with the left foot. Swing arms naturally.\\nMARCHING TO THE REAR\\n4-20. This movement is used to change the direction of a marching element 180 degrees in a uniform manner.\\nIt is only executed while marching forward with a 30-inch step. To March to the Rear, the command Rear,\\nMARCH is given as the right foot strikes the marching surface. On the command of execution MARCH,\\n4-8 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Individual Drill\\ntake one more step with the left foot, pivot 180 degrees to the right on the balls of both feet, and step off in\\nthe new direction taking a 30-inch step with the trail foot. Do not allow the arms to swing outward while\\nturning.\\nREST MOVEMENT, 30-INCH STEP\\n4-21. Rest movements with the 30-inch step include At Ease March and Route Step March:\\n\\uf06c At Ease March. The command At Ease, MARCH is given as either foot strikes the marching\\nsurface. On the command of execution MARCH, the Soldier is no longer required to retain\\ncadence; however, silence and the approximate interval and distance are maintained. Quick Time,\\nMARCH and Route Step, MARCH are the only commands that can be given while marching at\\nease.\\n\\uf06c Route Step March. Route Step March is executed identically to At Ease March except that Soldiers\\nmay drink from their canteens and talk.\\nNote. To change the direction of march while marching at Route Step or At Ease March, the\\ncommander informally directs the lead element to turn in the desired direction. Before precision\\nmovements may be executed, the unit must resume marching in cadence. The troops automatically\\nresume marching at Attention on the command Quick Time, MARCH as the commander\\nreestablishes the cadence by counting eight steps. If necessary, Soldiers individually execute\\nchange step to get back in step with the unit.\\nTHE 15-INCH STEP, FORWARD OR HALF STEP\\n4-22. Use the following procedures to execute the 15-inch step, forward or half step. The 15-inch step is\\ncommonly known as the Half Step:\\n\\uf06c To march with a 15-inch step from the Halt, the command is Half step, MARCH. On the\\npreparatory command Half Step, shift the weight of the body to the right foot without noticeable\\nmovement. On the command of execution MARCH, step forward 15 inches with the left foot and\\ncontinue marching with 15-inch steps. The arms swing as in marching with a 30-inch step.\\n\\uf06c To alter the march to a 15-inch step while marching with a 30-inch step, the command is Half\\nStep, MARCH. This command may be given as either foot strikes the marching surface. On the\\ncommand of execution MARCH, take one more 30-inch step and then begin marching with a\\n15-inch step. The arms swing as in marching with a 30-inch step.\\n\\uf06c To resume marching with a 30-inch step, the command Forward, MARCH is given as either foot\\nstrikes the marching surface. On the command of execution MARCH, take one more 15-inch step\\nand then begin marching with a 30-inch step.\\n\\uf06c The Halt while marching at the Half Step is executed in two counts, the same as the Halt from\\nthe 30-inch step. While marching at the Half Step, the only commands that may be given are:\\nMark Time, MARCH; Normal Interval, Forward, MARCH; MARCH; and HALT.\\nMARCHING IN PLACE\\n4-23. To march in place, use the following procedures:\\n\\uf06c To march in place, the command Mark Time, MARCH is given as either foot strikes the marching\\nsurface and only while marching with a 30-inch or 15-inch step forward. On the command of\\nexecution MARCH, take one more step, bring the trailing foot alongside the leading foot, and\\nbegin to march in place. Raise each foot alternately 2 inches off the marching surface; the arms\\nswing naturally, as when marching with a 30-inch step forward.\\nNote. While marking time in formation, the Soldier adjusts position to ensure proper alignment\\nand cover. The proper distance between Soldiers while marching is one-arm length plus 6 inches\\n(approximately 40 inches).\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 4-9Chapter 4\\n\\uf06c To resume marching with a 30-inch step, the command Forward, MARCH is given as either foot\\nstrikes the marching surface. On the command of execution MARCH, take one more step in place\\nand then step off with a 30-inch step.\\n\\uf06c The Halt from Mark Time is executed in two counts, the same as the Halt from the 30-inch step.\\nTHE 15-INCH STEP, RIGHT OR LEFT\\n4-24. To march with a 15-Inch Step Right (Left), use the following procedures:\\n\\uf06c To march with a 15-Inch Step Right (Left), the command is Right (Left) Step, MARCH. The\\ncommand is given only while at the Halt. On the preparatory command of Right (Left) Step, shift\\nthe weight of the body without noticeable movement onto the left (right) foot. On the command\\nof execution MARCH, bend the right knee slightly and raise the right foot only high enough to\\nallow freedom of movement. Place the right foot 15 inches to the right of the left foot, then move\\nthe left foot (keeping the left leg straight) alongside the right foot as in the Position of Attention.\\nContinue this movement, keeping the arms at the sides as in the Position of Attention.\\n\\uf06c To Halt when executing Right or Left Step, the command is Squad (Platoon), HALT. This\\nmovement is executed in two counts. The preparatory command is given when the heels are\\ntogether; the command of execution HALT is given the next time the heels are together. On the\\ncommand of execution HALT, take one more step with the lead foot and then place the trailing\\nfoot alongside the lead foot, resuming the Position of Attention.\\nTHE 15-INCH STEP, BACKWARD\\n4-25. To march backward using the 15-inch step, use the following procedures:\\n\\uf06c To march with a 15-Inch Step Backward, the command is Backward, MARCH. The command is\\ngiven only while at the Halt. On the preparatory command Backward, shift the weight of the body\\nwithout noticeable movement onto the right foot. On the command of execution MARCH, take a\\n15-inch step backward with the left foot and continue marching backward with 15-inch steps. The\\narms swing naturally.\\n\\uf06c The Halt from Backward March is executed in two counts, the same as the Halt from the 30-inch\\nstep.\\nTHE 30-INCH STEP, DOUBLE-TIME\\n4-26. To Double-Time using the 30-inch step, use the following procedures:\\n\\uf06c To march in the cadence of 180 steps per minute with a 30-inch step, the command is Double\\nTime, MARCH. It may be commanded while at the Halt or while marching at Quick Time with a\\n30-inch step.\\n\\uf06c When at the Halt and the preparatory command Double Time is given, shift the weight of the body\\nto the right foot without noticeable movement. On the command of execution MARCH, raise the\\nforearms to a horizontal position, with the fingers and thumbs closed, knuckles out, and\\nsimultaneously step off with the left foot. Continue to march with 30-inch steps at the cadence of\\nDouble Time. The arms swing naturally to the front and rear with the forearms kept horizontal.\\n(When armed, Soldiers will come to Port Arms on receiving the preparatory command of Double\\nTime.) Guides, when at Sling Arms, will Double-Time with their weapons at Sling Arms upon\\nreceiving the directive GUIDE ON LINE.\\n\\uf06c When marching with a 30-inch step in the cadence of Quick Time, the command Double Time,\\nMARCH is given as either foot strikes the marching surface. On the command of execution\\nMARCH, take one more 30-inch step at Quick Time and step off with the trailing foot,\\ndouble-timing as previously described.\\n\\uf06c To resume marching with a 30-inch step at Quick Time, the command Quick time, MARCH is\\ngiven as either foot strikes the marching surface. On the command of execution MARCH, take\\ntwo more 30-inch steps at double-time, lower the arms to the sides, and resume marching with a\\n30-inch step at Quick Time.\\n4-10 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Individual Drill\\nNote. Quick Time, Column Half Left (Right), and Column Left (Right) are the only movements\\nthat can be executed while double-timing. Armed troops must be at Port Arms before the command\\nDouble Time, MARCH is given.\\nFACING IN MARCHING\\n4-27. Facings in Marching from the Halt are important parts of the following movements: alignments,\\ncolumn movements, inspecting Soldiers in ranks, and changing from Normal Interval to Double Interval or\\nDouble Interval to Normal Interval. (Double interval is defined as the lateral space between Soldiers,\\nmeasured from right to left by raising both arms shoulder high with the fingers extended and joined\\n[palms down] so that fingertips are touching the fingertips of the Soldiers to the right and to the left.):\\n\\uf06c For instructional purposes only, the command Face to the Right (Left) in Marching, MARCH\\nmay be used to teach the individual to execute the movement properly. On the preparatory\\ncommand Face to the Right (Left) in Marching, shift the weight of the body without noticeable\\nmovement onto the right foot. On the command of execution MARCH, pivot to the right (left) on\\nthe ball of the right foot (90 degrees) and step off in the indicated direction with the left foot.\\nExecute the pivot and step in one count and continue marching in the new direction. (See\\nparagraph 4-17, third bullet, and chapter 3, paragraph 3-2, first bullet.)\\n\\uf06c Facing to the Half-Right (Half-Left) in Marching from the Halt is executed in the same manner as\\nFacing to the Right (Left) in Marching from a Halt, except the facing movement is made at a\\n45-degree angle to the right (left).\\n\\uf06c The Halt from Facing in Marching is executed in two counts, the same as the Halt from the\\n30-inch step.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 4-11This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 5\\nIndividual Drill with Weapons\\n\u201cFeed \u2018em up and give \u2018em hell.

When performing duty requiring the\\nuse of the magazine, the carbine is carried at Sling Arms.\\n\\uf06c The command Port, ARMS must be given before the command for Double Time.\\n\\uf06c Facings, alignments, and short-distance marching movements are executed from Order Arms or\\nSling Arms. When the movement has been completed, automatically return the carbine to\\nOrder Arms.\\n5-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Individual Drill with Weapons\\n\\uf06c Facing movements are executed from Order Arms or Sling Arms. When a Facing is necessary to\\nestablish the direction of march, the Facing movement is executed before the command for the\\nmanual of arms. After a marching movement has been completed, Order, ARMS or Sling, ARMS\\nis commanded before the command for the facing movement.\\n\\uf06c Ready, Port, ARMS must be commanded following Inspection Arms and before any other\\nmovements can be commanded.\\n\\uf06c Port Arms is the key position assumed in most manual of arms movements from one position to\\nanother except Right Shoulder Arms from Order Arms and Order Arms from Right Shoulder Arms.\\n\\uf06c Manual of arms movements are a combination of the Position of Attention and the procedures for\\nthe prescribed movement. Most manual of arms movements are executed with the head, eyes, and\\nbody as in the Position of Attention.\\n\\uf06c Sling Arms is the appropriate position assumed to carry the carbine while marching in most\\nsituations. Port Arms is only used when slings are unavailable or unless specifically required by\\nlocal conditions.\\nNote. Paragraphs 5-2 through 5-9 refer to slings tight. However, all individual and unit drill\\nmovements may be executed with slings loose except when executing Fix Bayonets and Unfix\\nBayonets.\\nORDER ARMS\\n5-3.

This section describes the formations and movements of a squad. Individual drill movements and the\\nmanual of arms are executed, as previously described in chapters 4 and 5, while performing as a squad\\nmember.\\nBASIC INFORMATION\\n6-2. The squad has two prescribed formations\u2014line and column. However, the squad may be formed into\\na column of twos from a column formation. When the squad is in line, squad members are numbered from\\nright to left; when in column, from front to rear. The squad normally marches in column, but for short\\ndistances it may march in line.\\n6-3. When the squad drills as a separate unit, the squad leader carries their weapon at Sling Arms. When\\nthe squad is in a line formation, the squad leader assumes a post three steps in front of and centered on the\\nsquad; when in a column or a column of twos, three steps to the left and centered on the squad. When the\\nsquad drills as part of a larger unit, the squad leader occupies the number one (base) position of the squad.\\nSquad leaders carry their weapon in the same manner as prescribed for other rifle bearers in the squad.\\nFORMING THE SQUAD\\n6-4. The squad normally forms in a line formation; however, it may re-form in column when each member\\ncan identify their exact position (equipment grounded) in the formation (see figure 6-1 on page 6-3).\\n6-5. To form at normal interval, the squad leader comes to the Position of Attention and commands\\nFALL IN. On the command FALL IN, the following actions occur simultaneously:\\n\\uf06c Each member double-times to their position in the formation.\\n\\uf06c The right flank Soldier positions themselves so that when the squad is formed it is three steps in\\nfront of and centered on the squad leader.\\n\\uf06c The right flank Soldier comes to the Position of Attention and raises their left arm laterally at\\nshoulder level, elbow locked, fingers and thumb extended and joined, and palm facing down. They\\nensure that the left arm is in line with the body.\\n\\uf06c The Soldier to the immediate left of the right flank Soldier comes to the Position of Attention,\\nturns their head and eyes to the right, and raises their left arm in the same manner as the right flank\\nSoldier. They obtain proper alignment by taking short steps forward or backward until they are on\\nline with the Soldiers on their right flank. They then obtain exact interval by taking short steps left\\nor right until their shoulder touches the extended fingertips of the Soldier on their right flank. As\\nsoon as the Soldier to the left has obtained equal interval, each Soldier individually lowers their\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 6-1Chapter 6\\narm to their side, sharply turns their head and eyes to the front, and assumes the Position of\\nAttention.\\n\\uf06c The right flank Soldier then sharply returns to the Position of Attention.\\n\\uf06c All other members of the squad form in the same manner except that the Soldiers on the left flank\\ndo not raise their left arm.\\nNote. Right flank Soldiers raise their arms and look straight to the front unless the squad is to align\\non an element to its right. If they are to align on an element to the right, they turn their head and\\neyes to the right and align themselves with that element.\\n6-6. To form at Close Interval, the formation is completed in the manner prescribed for Normal Interval,\\nexcept that the command is At Close Interval, FALL IN as seen in figure 6-1. Squad members obtain Close\\nInterval by placing the heel of the left hand on the left hip even with the waist, fingers and thumb joined and\\nextended downward, and with the elbow in line with the body and touching the arm of the Soldier to the left\\nas seen in figure 6-3 on page 6-6.\\n6-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Squad Drill\\nFigure 6-1. Squad formation\\n6-7. To form in column, the squad leader faces the proposed flank of the column and commands In Column,\\nFALL IN. On the command of execution FALL IN, squad members double-time to their original positions\\n(grounded equipment) in formation and cover on the Soldier to their front.\\nNote. The correct distance between Soldiers in column formation is approximately 36 inches. This\\ndistance is one-arm\u2019s length plus 6 inches.\\n6-8. When armed, squad members fall in at Order Arms or Sling Arms. For safety, the commands\\nInspection, ARMS; Ready, Port, ARMS; and Order (Sling), ARMS are commanded at the initial formation\\nof the day or when the last command is DISMISSED.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 6-3Chapter 6\\nCOUNTING OFF\\n6-9. The squad may count off in line or column formation. The command is Count, OFF:\\n\\uf06c When the squad is in a line formation, the counting is executed from right to left. On the command\\nof execution OFF, each member, except the Soldiers on the right flank, turns their head and eyes\\nto the right, and the right flank Soldier counts off \u201cONE.\u201d After the Soldier on the right counts off\\ntheir number, the Soldier to their left counts off with the next higher number and simultaneously\\nturns their head and eyes to the front. All the other members execute count off in the same manner\\nuntil the entire squad has counted off.\\n\\uf06c When the squad is in column formation, the counting is executed from front to rear. On the\\ncommand of execution OFF, the Soldier at the head of the column turns their head and eyes to the\\nright and counts over their shoulder, \u201cONE.\u201d After counting off their number, they immediately\\ncome to the Position of Attention. All other members count their numbers in sequence in the same\\nmanner as the number one Soldier; the last Soldier in the file does not turn their head and eyes to\\nthe right.\\nCHANGING INTERVAL WHILE IN LINE\\n6-10. To change interval while in line, use the following procedures:\\nNote. To ensure that each member understands the number of steps to take, the squad leader should\\ncommand Count, OFF before giving any commands that cause the squad to change interval.\\nMembers do not raise their arms when changing interval.\\n6-11. To obtain Close Interval from Normal Interval, the command is Close Interval, MARCH. On the\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the Soldiers on the right flank (number one person) stands fast. All Soldiers\\nto the left of the number one person execute Right Step March, take one step less than their number (for\\nexample, number five person takes four steps), and Halt.\\nNote. The squad leader takes the correct number of steps to maintain their position of three steps\\nin front of and centered on the squad.\\n6-12. To obtain Normal Interval from Close Interval, the command is Normal Interval, MARCH. On the\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the Soldiers on the right flank stands fast. All Soldiers to the left of number\\none person execute Left Step March, take one step less than their number (for example, the number nine\\nperson takes eight steps), and Halt.\\n6-13. To obtain Double Interval from Normal Interval, the command is Double Interval, MARCH. On the\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the Soldiers on the right flank stand fast. All Soldiers to the left of the\\nnumber one person face to the left as in marching, take one 30-inch step less than their number (for example,\\nnumber seven person takes six steps), Halt, and execute Right Face.\\n6-14. To obtain Normal Interval from Double Interval, the command is Normal Interval, MARCH. On the\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the Soldiers on the right flank stand fast. All Soldiers to the left of the\\nnumber one person face to the right as in marching, take one 30-inch step less than their number (for example,\\nnumber three person takes two steps), Halt, and execute Left Face.\\nALIGNMENT\\n6-15. Soldiers align front-to-back by covering on the Soldier to their front and align side-to-side by dressing\\nto the Soldier on their right. To cover, Soldiers position their heads, spines, and insides of the heels directly\\nbehind the corresponding locations of the Soldier in front of them. Soldiers dress by ensuring their shoulders\\nare perpendicular to the direction of march and their insteps are in line with the Soldier to their front.\\nFigure 6-2 shows Soldiers properly aligned at Normal Interval.\\n6-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Squad Drill\\nFigure 6-2. Proper alignment at normal interval\\nALIGNING THE SQUAD\\n6-16. To align the squad at Normal Interval, the commands are Dress Right, DRESS and Ready, FRONT.\\nThese commands are given only when armed Soldiers are at Order Arms or Sling Arms. On the command of\\nexecution DRESS, the Soldiers on the right flank stand fast. Each member, except the right flank person,\\nturns their head and eyes to the right and aligns themselves with the person on their right. Each member,\\nexcept the left flank person, extends their left arm laterally at shoulder level, elbow locked, fingers and thumb\\nextended and joined, palm facing down. They ensure their left arm is in line with their body and position\\nthemselves by short steps right or left until their right shoulder touches the fingertips of the Soldier on their\\nright. On the command of execution FRONT, each member returns sharply to the Position of Attention (see\\nfigure 6-3 on page 6-6).\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 6-5Chapter 6\\nNote. The squad leader commands the squad to the appropriate interval before giving the\\ncommand for alignment.\\nFigure 6-3. Alignment (close interval)\\n6-6 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Squad Drill\\nNote. If the squad leader wants exact alignment, on the command of execution DRESS, they face\\nto the Half Left in marching and march by the most direct route to a position on line with the squad,\\nhalt one step from the Soldiers on the right flank, and face down the line. From their position, they\\nverify the alignment of the squad, directing the Soldiers to move forward or backward, as\\nnecessary, calling them by name or number: \u201cPrivate Miller, forward 2 inches;\u201d \u201cNumber eight,\\nbackward 4 inches.\u201d The squad leader remains at attention, taking short steps to the right or left as\\nnecessary to see down the squad. Having aligned the squad, they center themselves on the right\\nflank person by taking short steps left or right. The squad leader then faces to the Half Right in\\nmarching, returns to their position (center of the squad), halts perpendicular to the formation, faces\\nto the left, and commands Ready, FRONT. These procedures also apply when aligning the squad\\nat Close or Double Interval.\\n6-17. To align the squad at Close Interval, the commands are At Close Interval, Dress Right, DRESS and\\nReady, FRONT. The movement is executed in the same manner prescribed for alignment at Normal Interval\\nexcept that the squad members obtain Close Interval (see figure 6-3, page 6-6).\\n6-18. To align the squad at Double Interval, the commands are At Double Interval, Dress Right, DRESS\\nand Ready, FRONT. These commands are given only when the troops are unarmed or at Sling Arms. On the\\ncommand of execution DRESS, each member (except the right flank Soldier) turns their head and eyes to\\nthe right and aligns themselves to the person to their right. At the same time, each member (except the right\\nand left flank person) extends both arms and positions themselves by short steps right or left until their\\nfingertips are touching the fingertips of the members on their right and left. (The right flank person raises\\ntheir left arm; the left flank person raises their right arm.)\\n6-19. To align the squad in column, the commands are COVER and RE-COVER. On the command\\nCOVER, each member (except the number one person) raises their left arm to a horizontal position, elbow\\nlocked, fingers and thumb extended and joined, palm facing down, and obtains an arm\u2019s length plus about\\n6 inches (from the fingertips) to the back of the Soldier to their front. At the same time, each Soldier aligns\\nthemselves directly behind the Soldier to their front. To resume the Position of Attention, the command RE-\\nCOVER is given. On this command, each member sharply returns to the Position of Attention.\\nMARCHING THE SQUAD\\n6-20. To march the squad, use the following procedures:\\n\\uf06c For short distances only, the squad may be marched forward while in a line formation.\\n\\uf06c When marching long distances, the squad is marched in column.\\n\\uf06c To form a column formation from a line formation, the command is Right, FACE.\\n\\uf06c When a column formation is originated from a line formation at Close Interval, the squad may be\\nmarched for short distances at the Half Step with less than correct distance. To obtain correct\\ndistance while marching with less than correct distance, the command is Extend, MARCH. On\\nthe command of execution MARCH, the number one person takes one more 15-inch step and then\\nsteps off with a 30-inch step. Each squad member begins marching with a 30-inch step at the\\napproximate point where the number one person stepped off, or as soon as correct distance has\\nbeen obtained.\\nNote. See chapter 4 for more information on marching movements.\\nCHANGING THE DIRECTION OF A COLUMN\\n6-21. To change the direction of a column from the Halt, the command to start the squad in motion and\\nsimultaneously change the direction of march 90 or 45 degrees is Column Right (Left), MARCH or Column\\nHalf Right (Left), MARCH. On the command of execution MARCH, the lead person faces to the right (left)\\nas in marching by pivoting to the right (left) on the ball of the right foot and steps off in the indicated direction\\ntaking a 30-inch step with the left foot and continues to march. The number two Soldier adjusts their step by\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 6-7Chapter 6\\nlengthening or shortening as necessary to reach the approximate pivot point of the lead person. When they\\nreach the approximate pivot point of the lead Soldier, they pivot to the right (left) on the ball of the lead foot\\ntaking a 30-inch step with the trail foot in the new direction. All other members step off with the left foot and\\ncontinue to march forward taking 30-inch steps and execute in the same manner as the number two person in\\napproximately the same place until the entire squad has executed the column movement.\\n6-22. To change the direction of march 90 or 45 degrees when marching, the preparatory command Column\\nRight (Left) or Column Half Right (Half Left) is given as the foot (in the desired direction) strikes the\\nmarching surface. The command of execution MARCH is given the next time the foot in the desired direction\\nstrikes the marching surface. On the command of execution MARCH, the lead person takes one additional\\nstep, pivots in the commanded direction as the pivot foot strikes the marching surface and continues to march\\nin the new direction. Other members continue to march forward and execute the pivot as prescribed from the\\nHalt.\\n6-23. To avoid an obstacle in the line of march, the squad leader directs INCLINE LEFT (RIGHT). The\\nlead person inclines Left (Right) around the obstacle and resumes the original direction. All other members\\nfollow the lead person.\\nMARCHING TO THE REAR\\n6-24. The command Rear, MARCH is given to the squad to change the direction of the marching element\\n180 degrees, in a uniform manner. Just like in individual drill (see paragraph 4-20), this movement is executed\\nwhile marching forward with a 30-inch step. To March to the Rear, the command Rear, MARCH is given\\nas the right foot strikes the marching surface. On the command of execution MARCH, take one more step\\nwith the left foot, pivot 180 degrees to the right on the balls of both feet, and step off in the new direction\\ntaking a 30-inch step with the trail foot. Do not allow the arms to swing outward while turning.\\nMARCHING TO THE FLANK\\n6-25. The squad may be marched to the flank (for short distances only) when marching in column. The\\ncommand for this movement is Right (Left) Flank, MARCH. The preparatory command is given as the foot\\nin the desired direction strikes the marching surface, and the command of execution is given the next time\\nthe foot in the desired direction strikes the marching surface. On the command of execution MARCH, all\\nmembers take one more step, pivot 90 degrees in the commanded direction on the ball of the lead foot, and\\nstep off in the new direction with the trailing foot. As the members begin to march in the new direction, they\\nglance out of the corner of their right eye and dress to the right.\\nFORMING A COLUMN OF TWOS AND RE-FORMING\\n6-26. To form a column of twos and re-form, use the following procedures:\\n\\uf06c Forming a column of twos from a file is executed only from the Halt. The command is Column\\nof Twos to the Right (Left), MARCH. On the preparatory command, the lead team leader\\ncommands STAND FAST. The trailing team leader commands Column Half Right (Left). On\\nthe command of execution MARCH, the trailing team leader executes a Column Half Right\\n(Left), inclines to the left or right when the correct interval is obtained, and commands Mark time,\\nMARCH and Team, HALT to Halt abreast of the lead team leader.\\n\\uf06c Forming a file from a column of twos is executed only from the Halt. The command is File from\\nthe Left (Right), MARCH. On the preparatory command, the lead team leader commands\\nFORWARD. The trailing team leader commands STAND FAST. On the command of execution\\nMARCH, the lead team marches forward. The trailing team leader commands Column Half Left\\n(Right) when the second person from the rear of the lead team is abreast. They give the command\\nMARCH when the last person of the lead team is abreast of them and their right foot strikes the\\nmarching surface. They then incline right or left to follow the lead team at the correct distance.\\n6-8 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Squad Drill\\nNote. Commands are given over the team leader\u2019s right shoulder if the direction of movement is\\nto the right or if the team is following an element to its right. Commands are given over the left\\nshoulder if the direction of movement is to the left or if the team is following an element to its left.\\nDISMISSING THE SQUAD\\n6-27. The squad is dismissed with the members at Attention. With armed troops, the commands are\\nInspection, ARMS; Ready, Port, ARMS; Order (Sling), ARMS; and DISMISSED. With unarmed troops,\\nthe command is DISMISSED.\\nNote. Unless otherwise stated (by the person in charge in their instructions before the command\\nDISMISSED), the command DISMISSED terminates only the formation, not the duty day.\\n6-28. The command Fall Out will only be used when an individual or individuals are being removed from\\nthe formation and the entire formation is not being dismissed. For example, Sergeant Jones, Fall Out or\\nThird Squad, Fall Out. In this situation, the remainder of the formation would stay at the current\\nconfiguration until the command Dress Right, Dress (At Close Interval, Dress Right, Dress) or Cover are\\ngiven.\\nSECTION II \u2013 STACK AND TAKE ARMS (M4-SERIES CARBINE)\\n6-29. The squad members execute Stack and Take Arms from their positions in line formation (at Normal\\nInterval) from Order Arms. When in line formation, the squad leader commands Count, OFF and then\\ndesignates the stack person by numbers (for example, 2-5-8).\\nNotes. 1. M4-series carbines are not compatible with the M16-series rifles when stacking arms.\\nThe two types of weapons must be stacked separately or grounded in a manner that will not\\ndamage the sights. (See appendix C for a detailed explanation of Stack Arms and Take Arms for\\nthe M14-series rifle.)\\n2. When the squad is part of a larger unit, stack arms may be executed in a column formation\\n(when the formation consists of three or more files and the squads are at normal interval). Second\\nor third squad is designated as the stack squad.\\nPREPARE SLINGS\\n6-30. After the stack person is designated, the squad leader then commands Prepare, SLINGS. On the\\ncommand of execution SLINGS, each stack person (or stack squad) reaches across the body with their left\\nhand and grasp the handguards just above the slip ring. With the right hand they place the butt on the right\\nhip and cradles the carbine in the crook of the right arm. Using both hands, they adjust the sling keeper so\\nthat a 2-inch loop is formed from the sling keeper to the upper sling swivel. As soon as the loop is prepared,\\nthey return to Order Arms.\\nSTACK ARMS\\n6-31. When all stack personnel have returned to Order Arms, the squad leader commands Stack, ARMS. On\\nthe command of execution ARMS, each stack person reaches across the body with the left hand and grasps\\nthe handguards just above the slip ring. Designated stack persons then grasp the barrel of their carbine with\\ntheir right hand and place the carbine directly in front of and centered on their body with the sling side to the\\nfront. The butt (fully extended) is placed on the marching surface so that the heel of the butt (or side of the\\nbutt if the sling is side mounted) is on line with the toes of the stack person\u2019s footgear. Stack persons bend\\ndeeply forward at the waist and grasp their carbine with their left hand at the upper portion of the handguard,\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 6-9Chapter 6\\nkeeping the carbine vertical at all times. The first two fingers of the left hand hold the inner part of the loop\\nagainst the carbine. Stack persons reach across the front of the carbine with their right hand, grasp the outer\\npart of the loop, and hold it open for insertion of other carbines (see figure 6-4 on page 6-11).\\n6-32. On the command of execution ARMS, the Soldiers to the right and left of the stack person perform the\\nfollowing movements simultaneously:\\n\\uf06c The Soldier on the stack person\u2019s right reach across the body with the left hand and grasps the\\nhandguard. They release the grasp of their right hand and regrasp the carbine at the small of the\\nstock. They lower both arms with the elbows locked (holding the carbine in a horizontal position\\nwith the muzzle to the left and the magazine well to the front).\\n\\uf06c The Soldier on the stack person\u2019s left reaches across the body with the left hand and grasps the\\ncarbine at the small of the stock, releases the right hand, and regrasps the handguard. They then\\nlower both arms with the elbows locked (holding the carbine in a horizontal position with the\\nmuzzle to the right and magazine well to the front).\\n6-33. As soon as the stack person has placed their carbine in position, both Soldiers move the foot nearest\\nthe stack person halfway (Half Right or Half Left) toward the stack person. The Soldier on the stack person\u2019s\\nleft inserts the muzzle of their carbine into the loop to a point about halfway between the flash suppressor\\nand the front sight assembly. They hold their carbine in this position until the Soldier on the stack person\u2019s\\nright inserts the muzzle of their carbine in a similar manner and above the other muzzle.\\n6-34. Without moving the feet, both Soldiers swing the butt of their carbines out and then down to the\\nmarching surface, making the stack tight with the butts of the carbines on line and about 1 foot from the base\\nline. When the stack has been completed, all three Soldiers resume the Position of Attention.\\n6-35. Additional carbines are passed to the nearest stack on the right (right or left if stacked in column). The\\nSoldier with additional rifles grasps the handguards with the left hand, release the grasp of the right hand and\\nregrasps the weapon at the barrel. The Soldiers release the grasp of the left hand and raise the carbine\\nvertically with the magazine well to the front, wrist held shoulder high, elbow locked, and right arm extended\\nto the right front. Throughout the pass, the carbine is held vertical with the magazine well to the front:\\n\\uf06c The Soldier to the left of the stack person then grasps the carbine at the handguard with their left\\nhand. The Soldier passing the additional carbine then releases the carbine and sharply returns to\\nthe Position of Attention. The Soldier to the left of the stack person then moves the carbine to the\\nright until it is centered on their body, and they grasp the barrel with their right hand, wrist held\\nshoulder high and elbow locked. They then release the left hand and sharply returns their left hand\\nto the left side as in the Position of Attention. They then move the carbine to their right front.\\n\\uf06c The stack person receives the carbine and centers it in the same manner as previously described\\nin paragraph 6-33. The Soldier to the left of the stack person sharply returns to the Position of\\nAttention after they release the carbine. Once the stack person has centered the carbine and grasped\\nthe barrel with the right hand, they bend forward at the waist and places the carbine in the stack\\nso that it is secure (without damaging the front sight assembly). If there are two additional carbines,\\nthe second carbine is passed in the same manner as the first.\\nTAKE ARMS\\n6-36. To Take Arms, the command is Take, ARMS. On the command of execution ARMS, the Soldier return\\nthe additional carbines in the same manner as the carbines were received. The stack person secures the stack\\nand holds the loop in the same manner as for stacking carbines. The Soldiers on the left and right step toward\\nthe stack person in the same manner as when stacking arms. Each Soldier reaches down and regrasps their\\ncarbine (one hand at the small of the stock and one hand midway of the handguard) and brings it to the\\nhorizontal position. The Soldier on the right frees their carbine first and resumes Order Arms. The Soldier on\\nthe left frees their carbine and resumes Order Arms. The stack person cradles their carbine and adjusts the\\nsling and sling keeper to its original position and then resumes Order Arms.\\n6-10 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Squad Drill\\nFigure 6-4. Stack weapons (M4)\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 6-11This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 7\\nPlatoon Drill\\n\u201cIf in training Soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be\\nwell-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.\u201d\\nSun Tsu, On the Art of War, trans. 1910\\nSECTION I \u2013 FORMATIONS\\n7-1. The platoon has two prescribed formations\u2014line and column (see figure 7-1 on page 7-2 and figure 7-2\\non page 7-3). However, the platoon may be formed into a file or a column of twos from a column formation.\\nWhen in a line formation, the elements (squads) of a platoon are numbered from front to rear; in a column\\nformation, from left to right.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 7-1Chapter 7\\nFigure 7-1. Line formation\\n7-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Platoon Drill\\nFigure 7-2. Column formation\\nBASIC INFORMATION\\n7-2. For the most part, platoon drill merely provides the procedures for executing drill movements in\\nconjunction with other squads formed in the same formation. Individual drill movements and the manual of\\narms are executed, as previously described in chapters 4, 5, and 6, while performing as a squad member\\nduring the conduct of platoon drill. For continuity purposes in this chapter, \u201cplatoon sergeant\u201d may also\\ndenote \u201cplatoon leader\u201d when the platoon sergeant is executing drill from their post.\\n7-3. During all drill and ceremonies, the platoon leader and platoon sergeant carry their rifles at Sling Arms.\\nWhen the platoon drills as part of a larger unit, the platoon leader and platoon sergeant remain at Sling Arms\\nduring all manual of arms movements except when executing the Hand Salute while at Sling Arms.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 7-3Chapter 7\\n7-4. When the platoon drills as a separate unit or as part of a larger unit in a line formation, without officers\\npresent, the post for the platoon sergeant is three steps in front of and centered on the platoon. When in\\ncolumn formation, the post for the platoon sergeant is three steps to left flank of and centered on the platoon.\\nThe post for the platoon sergeant with the platoon leader present is one step to the rear and centered on the\\nplatoon in line or column formation.\\n7-5. When assuming their post in column from a line formation with the platoon leader present, the platoon\\nsergeant faces to the left in marching (on the command of execution FACE) and marches in the most direct\\nroute to their post. The platoon sergeant then halts and faces to the right. When assuming their post in line\\nfrom a column formation, they face to the right in marching (on the command of execution FACE) and march\\nin the most direct route to their post, halt centered on the platoon, and face to the left.\\nNote. When the files (columns) are uneven, the platoon sergeant normally directs the Soldiers in\\nlonger files to move to another file to balance the formation or may fill the vacancy themselves as\\nthe last person in the right file.\\n7-6. When control of the formation is being exchanged between the platoon sergeant and the platoon leader,\\nthe platoon sergeant will always travel around the right flank (squad leader) of the formation when marching\\nfrom post to post. The platoon leader will always travel around the left flank of the formation when marching\\npost to post.\\n7-7. On the command Open Ranks, MARCH; Backward, MARCH; Right (Left) Step, MARCH;\\nForward, MARCH and on commands that cause the platoon to change interval in line, they move at the\\nsame time (with the appropriate step) so as to maintain proper position.\\n7-8. The leader of the first squad serves as the base when the platoon is in a line formation. The leader of\\nthe fourth squad serves as the base when the platoon is in a column formation.\\n7-9. If for some reason the platoon is authorized a guidon or phase banner (in training units, for example),\\nthe bearer\u2019s post is one step in front of and two 15-inch steps to the right of and facing the person forming\\nthe platoon. When the formation is faced to the right for a marching movement, they execute in the same\\nmanner as explained in appendix G, except that their post is three steps in front of and centered on the squad\\nleaders. If the platoon leader is present and at their post, the bearer\u2019s post is one step to the rear and two\\n15-inch steps to the left of the platoon leader.\\n7-10. When the platoon drills as a separate unit, in a line formation, the post for the platoon leader is six\\nsteps in front of and centered on the platoon; when in a column formation, the platoon leader is six steps to\\nthe left flank and centered on the platoon. When marching as part of a larger formation, their post is one step\\nin front of and centered on the squad leaders.\\n7-11. When the platoon leader commands Open Ranks, MARCH; Backward, MARCH; Right (Left) Step,\\nMARCH; Forward, MARCH or causes the platoon to change interval, they move at the same time (with\\nthe appropriate step) so as to maintain proper position:\\n\\uf06c When assuming their post in column from a line formation, the platoon leader faces to the right in\\nmarching (on the command of execution FACE) and marches in the most direct route to their post,\\nhalts, and faces to the left.\\n\\uf06c When assuming their post in line from a column formation, the platoon leader faces to the left in\\nmarching (on the command of execution FACE) and marches in the most direct route to their post,\\nhalts perpendicular to the formation, and faces to the right.\\nFORMING THE PLATOON\\n7-12. The platoon normally forms in a line formation; however, it may re-form in a column when each\\nSoldier can identify their exact position (equipment grounded) in the formation.\\n7-13. The platoon forms basically the same as a squad. The platoon sergeant assumes the Position of\\nAttention and commands FALL IN (At Close Interval, FALL IN or In Column, FALL IN). On the\\ncommand FALL IN (At Close Interval, FALL IN), the squad leader and the first squad (when formed) are\\n7-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Platoon Drill\\nthree steps in front of and centered on the platoon sergeant. Other squad leaders cover on the first squad\\nleader at the correct distance, which is obtained by estimation. The members of the first squad fall in on their\\nsquad leader as prescribed for squad drill. Members of the other squads fall in on their squad leader, assume\\nthe Position of Attention, and turn their heads and eyes to the right. They obtain correct distance by taking\\nshort steps forward or backward and align themselves on the Soldier to their right. They then sharply turn\\ntheir heads and eyes to the front as in the Position of Attention and obtain proper interval by taking short\\nsteps left and right to cover on the Soldier to their front. Members of all squads, other than the first squad,\\nwill not raise their left arms unless the Soldier to their immediate left has no one to their front in the formation\\non which to cover.\\n7-14. When armed, members fall in at Order Arms or Sling Arms. For safety, the commands Inspection,\\nARMS; Ready, Port, ARMS; Order (Sling), ARMS are given at the initial formation of the day and just\\nbefore the last command, DISMISSED.\\n7-15. When a report is appropriate, the platoon sergeant commands REPORT. The squad leaders, in\\nsuccession from front to rear, turn their heads and eyes toward the platoon sergeant and salute (holding the\\nSalute until returned) and report. The squad leaders do not state the unit. For example\u2014\\n\\uf06c Situation 1. When all squad members are in formation, the report is \u201cAll present.\u201d\\n\\uf06c Situation 2. When squad members are absent, the Soldiers name and reasons for absence are\\nreported:\\n\\uf0a7 Private Smit\u2014charge of quarter\u2019s runner.\\n\\uf0a7 Private Miller\u2014sick call.\\n\\uf0a7 Private Rodriguez\u2014absent without leave.\\n7-16. Platoon sergeants turn their head and eyes toward the reporting squad leader, receive the report, and\\nreturn the salute. After receiving the report from the squad leaders, the platoon sergeant faces about and\\nawaits the arrival of the platoon leader or a directive from the first sergeant to REPORT. When the platoon\\nleader has halted at their post, the platoon sergeant salutes and reports, \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, All present,\u201d or \u201cSir\\nor Ma\u2019am, All accounted for,\u201d or \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, (so many) Soldiers are absent.\u201d The platoon leader returns\\nthe Salute. After the Salute has been returned, the platoon sergeant faces to the right in marching, inclines\\naround the squad leaders, halts at their post, and faces to the right. If reporting to the first sergeant, the platoon\\nsergeant turns their head and eyes toward the first sergeant, salutes, and reports.\\n7-17. If the platoon leader is not present for the formation, and the commander is in charge of the formation,\\nthe platoon sergeant steps forward three steps to be a total of six steps and centered on their platoon (after\\nreceiving the squad leader\u2019s report) and, on the command POST, assumes the duties of the platoon leader.\\n7-18. When appropriate, the platoon may be formed by the platoon leader rather than by the platoon sergeant.\\nThe procedures are the same as previously described in paragraph 7-17 except that the first squad forms six\\nsteps in front of and centered on the platoon leader, and the platoon sergeant forms at their post to the rear of\\nthe platoon. For continuity purposes in this chapter, \u201cplatoon sergeant\u201d may also denote \u201cplatoon leader\u201d\\nwhen the platoon leader is executing drill from their post.\\nBREAKING RANKS\\n7-19. When the situation requires, the platoon sergeant directs: \u201cPrivate Rodriguez (pause), front and\\ncenter;\u201d or \u201cThe following personnel front and center\u2014Private Rodriguez (pause), Private Miller.\u201d When\\nthe individual\u2019s name is called, they assume the Position of Attention and reply, \u201cHere, Sergeant (Sir or\\nMa\u2019am).\u201d They then take one (15-inch) step backward, halt, face to the right (left) in marching, and exit the\\nformation by marching to the nearest flank. The Soldier does not look left or right. Once the individual has\\ncleared the formation, they begin to double-time and halt two steps in front of and centered on the platoon\\nsergeant.\\nNote. When a group of individuals are called from the formation, the group forms centered on the\\nplatoon sergeant. The platoon sergeant should direct (point) the first Soldier into position so that\\nthe rank will be centered when the last Soldier has joined the group.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 7-5Chapter 7\\nCOUNTING OFF\\n7-20. The platoon counts off in the same manner as the squad. When in a line formation, the squads count in\\nunison from right to left; each squad leader sounds off, \u201cONE.\u201d When in a column formation, the Soldiers\\nabreast of each other count in unison from front to rear; each squad leader sounds off, \u201cONE.\u201d\\nCHANGING INTERVAL\\n7-21. The platoon changes interval in a line formation in the same manner as the squad. To change interval\\nwhen the platoon is in a column at the Halt, the right file stands fast and serves as the base. All other members\\n(abreast of each other) execute the movement as previously described in paragraph 6-10. To obtain\\nClose Interval from Normal Interval, the third squad takes one right step, the second squad takes two right\\nsteps, and the first squad takes three right steps. To obtain Normal Interval, the procedures are the same\\nexcept that the squads execute the same number of left steps.\\n7-22. To change interval when the platoon is marching in a column, the preparatory command Close Interval\\nis given as the right foot strikes the marching surface, and the command of execution MARCH is given the\\nnext time the right foot strikes the marching surface. On the command of execution MARCH, the base squad\\n(right file) takes one more 30-inch step and then executes the Half Step. All other Soldiers take one more\\nstep, simultaneously execute a Column Half Right, and march until Close Interval is obtained. They execute\\na Column Half Left and assume the Half Step when abreast of the corresponding Soldier of the base squad.\\nOn the command Forward, MARCH, all Soldiers resume marching with a 30-inch step. The commands\\nMark Time, MARCH and Platoon, HALT may also be given.\\n7-23. To resume marching at Normal Interval, the preparatory command Normal Interval is given as the left\\nfoot strikes the marching surface, and the command of execution MARCH is given the next time the left\\nfoot strikes the marching surface. On the command of execution MARCH, the platoon members obtain\\nNormal Interval in the same manner prescribed for Close Interval except that they each execute Column Half\\nLeft and then Column Half Right.\\n7-24. To obtain Double Interval from Normal Interval, the procedures are the same as from Close Interval\\nto Normal Interval.\\n7-25. To obtain Normal Interval from Double Interval (closing the formation in column from Open Ranks),\\nthe procedures are the same as obtaining Close Interval from Normal Interval.\\nALIGNING THE PLATOON\\n7-26. The platoon is aligned similar to the squad. On the command of execution DRESS, the first squad\\nleader stands fast and serves as the base. Other squad leaders obtain correct distance by estimation. The\\nmembers of the first squad execute in the same manner as in squad drill to obtain exact interval. All other\\nsquads execute as the first squad, except that each squad member raises the left arm only for uniformity,\\ncovering (glancing out the corner of the left eye) on the Soldier to the front.\\n7-27. If the platoon sergeant wants exact alignment, they face to the Half Left (Half Right) in marching and\\nmarch (on the command of execution DRESS) by the most direct route to a position on line with the first\\nsquad, halt one step from the squad leader or left flank Soldier, and face down the line. From this position,\\nthey verify the alignment of the first squad, directing the Soldier to move forward or backward, as necessary,\\ncalling them by name or number: \u201cPrivate Smit, forward 2 inches; Number eight, backward 4 inches.\u201d The\\nplatoon sergeant remains at Attention, taking short steps to the right or left as necessary, to see down the\\nsquad:\\n\\uf06c Having aligned the first squad, the platoon sergeant, after centering themselves on the first squad,\\nfaces to the Left (Right) in marching, taking two (three if at open ranks) short steps to the next\\nsquad, halts, faces down the line, and aligns the squad in the same manner.\\n\\uf06c After the last squad is aligned, the platoon sergeant centers themselves on the squad leader by\\ntaking short steps left or right, faces to the Right (Left) in marching, returns to their position\\n(centered on the platoon), halts perpendicular to the formation, faces to the Left (Right), and\\ncommands Ready, FRONT.\\n7-6 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Platoon Drill\\nNote. When the platoon dresses as part of a larger formation, all squad leaders turn their heads and\\neyes to their right and align themselves on the unit to their right. The platoon sergeant aligns the\\nplatoon from the left flank rather than from the right flank when their platoon is not formed as the\\nright flank platoon.\\n7-28. To align the platoon in column, the commands are COVER and RE-COVER. On the command\\nCOVER, the fourth squad leader stands fast and serves as base. The squad leaders, except for the left flank\\nsquad leader, raise their arms laterally and turn their heads and eyes to the right. The members of the fourth\\nsquad raise their left arms horizontally (as in squad drill) to the front and cover the Soldier to their front at\\ncorrect distance (one arm\u2019s length plus 6 inches). Squad members of the third, second, and first squads raise\\ntheir left arms horizontally to the front (for uniformity only), cover on the Soldier to their front, and, at the\\nsame time, glance out of the corner of their right eyes aligning on the Soldiers to their right. To resume the\\nPosition of Attention, the command is RE-COVER. On this command, each Soldier sharply returns to the\\nPosition of Attention.\\nNote. When the platoon is aligned in column as part of a larger unit but is not the lead platoon, the\\nsquad leaders do not raise their arms or turn their heads and eyes but cover on the squad to their\\nfront. The platoon sergeant must wait until the platoon to their front has been given the command\\nRE-COVER before giving the command COVER. If the platoon leader is at their post, they must\\nwait until the platoon leader of the platoon to their front has commanded RE-COVER before they\\nface about and give the command COVER.\\nOPENING AND CLOSING RANKS\\n7-29. Open Ranks, MARCH is executed from a line formation while at the halt. It may be executed while\\nat any of the prescribed intervals. The command for this movement is Open Ranks, MARCH. On the\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the front rank takes two steps forward, the second rank takes one step\\nforward, the third rank stands fast, and the fourth rank takes two 15-inch steps backward. If additional ranks\\nare present, the fifth rank takes four steps backward, and the sixth rank takes six steps backward.\\nNote. After taking the prescribed steps, the Soldiers do not raise their arms. If the platoon sergeant\\nwants exact interval or alignment, they command At Close Interval (At Double Interval), Dress\\nRight, DRESS. If the platoon is to align on an element to the right, the squad leaders turn their\\nheads and eyes to the right and align themselves with that element.\\n7-30. To Close Ranks, the command is Close Ranks, MARCH. On the command of execution MARCH,\\nthe first rank takes four steps backward, the second rank takes two steps backward, the third rank stands fast,\\nand the fourth rank takes one step forward. On the command of execution MARCH, the platoon leader and\\nplatoon sergeant take the appropriate number of steps to maintain their posts.\\nRESTING THE PLATOON\\n7-31. The platoon rests in the same manner prescribed previously in paragraphs 4-6 and 5-4. The platoon\\nsergeant places the platoon at the Position of Attention and then into one of the rest positions.\\nDISMISSING THE PLATOON\\n7-32. The procedures for dismissing the platoon are basically the same as prescribed for the squad. If the\\nplatoon sergeant so desires, the squads may be released to the control of the squad leaders. The platoon\\nsergeant commands TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR SQUADS, and Salutes are exchanged. The platoon\\nsergeant is no longer part of the formation.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 7-7Chapter 7\\nNote. Without leaving their positions, the squad leaders turn their heads and eyes over the left\\nshoulder and command FALL OUT. The squad leaders move to a position in the immediate area,\\nand command FALL IN. Then, they carry out the previous instructions and/or give any\\ninstructions for actions before the next duty formation.\\n7-33. At times the platoon sergeant may want to turn the formation over to a subordinate; for example, to\\nhave the subordinate march the platoon to a different location:\\n\\uf06c The platoon sergeant calls on an individual and the individual breaks rank (see paragraph 7-3).\\nThe designated Soldier posts two steps from and facing the platoon sergeant. The platoon sergeant\\npasses on any additional instructions and Salutes are exchanged. After exchanging Salutes, the\\nplatoon sergeant moves to a position where they can observe, or they may resume their post at the\\nrear of the formation.\\n\\uf06c The subordinate steps forward two steps and assumes the post of the platoon sergeant. The platoon\\nsergeant is no longer part of the formation; however, they may march alongside of, or behind, the\\nformation to make any corrections or to give further guidance, if necessary.\\n7-34. If the platoon leader is at their post, they command PLATOON SERGEANT. The platoon sergeant\\nfaces to the left in marching and inclines around the squad leaders\u2019 left flank, halts three steps in front of and\\ncentered on the platoon and faces to the right. The platoon leader then commands TAKE CHARGE OF\\nTHE PLATOON, and Salutes are exchanged. The platoon leader is no longer part of the formation. The\\nplatoon sergeant remains at their post, faces about, and carries out the platoon leader\u2019s instructions.\\nSECTION II \u2013 MOVEMENTS\\n7-35. The platoon marches in the same manner prescribed for the squad. When the platoon is marching in a\\nline, the first squad leader serves as the guide, and when the platoon is marching in a column, the fourth\\nsquad leader serves as the guide. When marching in line, each member of each squad (glancing out of the\\ncorner of their right eye) maintains alignment on the Soldier to their right. When marching in column, each\\nmember of the first, second, and third squads maintains alignment on the Soldier to their right.\\nEYES RIGHT\\n7-36. The platoon renders courtesy during ceremonies or when marching past the Colors by executing Eyes\\nRight. The commands for this movement are Eyes, RIGHT and Ready, FRONT.\\n7-37. At the Halt, all Soldiers (on the command of execution, RIGHT), while keeping their shoulders\\nparallel to the front, turn their heads and eyes to the right at a 45-degree angle. They focus on and follow the\\nperson passing to the front until they are again looking forward, at which time their heads and eyes remain\\nfixed to the front. Only the platoon leader renders the Hand Salute.\\n7-38. When marching, the preparatory command Eyes is given as the right foot strikes the marching surface\\nand the command of execution RIGHT is given the next time the right foot strikes the marching surface. On\\nthe command of execution RIGHT, all Soldiers, except the right file, turn their heads and eyes to the right\\nand align themselves on the right file while continuing to march. Soldiers in the right file do not turn their\\nheads and eyes but continue looking straight to the front and maintain correct distance. Only the platoon\\nleader salutes. To terminate the courtesy, the preparatory command Ready is given as the left foot strikes the\\nmarching surface, and the command of execution FRONT is given the next time the left foot strikes the\\nmarching surface. On the command of execution, the Soldiers turn their heads and eyes sharply to the front\\nand the platoon leader terminates the Hand Salute.\\nCHANGING THE DIRECTION OF A COLUMN\\n7-39. The platoon changes the direction of marching basically the same as the squad. During a column\\nmovement, the base element is the squad on the flank in the direction of the turn.\\n7-8 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Platoon Drill\\n7-40. To change the direction 90 degrees, the command is Column Right (Left), MARCH. On the command\\nof execution MARCH, the base squad executes the movement as in squad drill except that the squad leader\\ntakes one 30-inch step and then takes up the Half Step. The squad leader continues marching with the Half\\nStep until the other squad leaders come abreast. The other squad leaders, while maintaining correct (offset)\\ninterval, execute a 45-degree pivot and continue marching in an arc. As they come on line (abreast) with the\\nbase squad leader, they take up the Half Step. When all squad leaders are abreast, they step off with a 30-inch\\nstep without command. All other platoon members march forward on the command of execution and execute\\nthe column movement at approximately the same location as their squad leaders and in the same manner.\\nNote. When the platoon sergeant is marching their platoon as a separate unit or when the company\\nis marching without officers in charge, the platoon sergeant stays centered on the platoon. When\\nthe platoon leader and platoon sergeant are marching at their post in column as part of a larger\\nformation, they execute a Column Half Right (Left) rather than a 90-degree column movement.\\nAfter executing the Column Half Right (Left), they continue marching in an arc, incline as\\nnecessary, and resume their correct positions. After sensing that the squad leaders are abreast of\\neach other, the platoon leader resumes the 30-inch step. At times, the platoon leader may find it\\nnecessary to shorten or lengthen their step to maintain correct distance from the unit to the front.\\n7-41. To change the direction 45 degrees, the command is Column Half Right (Left), MARCH. On the\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the platoon executes the movement in the same manner as a 90-degree turn\\nexcept that the base squad leader, as well as the other squad leaders, execute a Column Half Right (Left).\\nNote. When executing a column movement at Double Time, elements adjust the length of their\\nsteps so that interval and distance are maintained through and beyond the pivot point.\\n7-42. To march a platoon in the opposite direction, the command Rear, MARCH is given by the platoon\\nsergeant the same way as previously discussed in paragraphs 4-20 and 6-26. The platoon marches in the\\nopposite direction (Rear, MARCH) in the same manner as the squad.\\n7-43. The platoon inclines in the same manner as the squad discussed in paragraph 6-24. The squad nearest\\nthe direction of the turn serves as the base. To avoid an obstacle in the path of the march, the platoon leader\\ndirects INCLINE AROUND LEFT (RIGHT).\\n7-44. When space is limited and the platoon sergeant wants to march their unit in the opposite direction\\n(reverse), with the squad leaders at the head of their squads, they command Counter-Column, MARCH. On\\nthe command of execution MARCH (at the Halt), the first squad marches forward three steps, executes a\\nColumn Right, marches across the front of the platoon, and executes another Column Right just beyond the\\nfourth squad. The second squad steps forward one step, executes a Column Right, marches forward, and\\nexecutes another Column Right between the third and fourth squads. The third squad executes two short\\nColumn Lefts from the Halt and marches between the remainder of the third squad and the second squad. The\\nfourth squad marches forward two steps, executes a Column Left, marches across the front of the platoon,\\nand executes another Column Left between the first and second squads (see figure 7-3 on page 7-10).\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 7-9Chapter 7\\nFigure 7-3. Counter-Column March at the Halt\\n7-45. As the third squad leader marches past the last person in the third squad, they and their squad begin to\\nmarch at the Half Step. After marching past the last Soldier in each file, all other squads incline to the right\\nand left as necessary, obtain Normal Interval on the third squad and begin to march with the Half Step. When\\nall squads are abreast of each other, they begin marching with a 30-inch step without command.\\n7-46. If a guidon or phase banner is present, on the command of execution MARCH of Counter-Column,\\nMARCH the bearer executes a Column Right, marches across the platoon, and executes another Column\\nRight just beyond the fourth squad, and then inclines as necessary to return to the bearers post.\\n7-47. During the movement, without the platoon leader present, the platoon sergeant marches alongside the\\nfirst squad. With the platoon leader present, the platoon sergeant marches one step to the rear and centered\\nbetween the second and third squads (see figure 7-2 on page 7-3) and the platoon leader marches alongside\\nthe first squad.\\n7-10 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Platoon Drill\\n7-48. When marching, the preparatory command Counter-Column is given as the left foot strikes the\\nmarching surface and the command of execution MARCH is given the next time the left foot strikes the\\nmarching surface. On the command of execution MARCH, the platoon executes the movement basically the\\nsame as from the Halt, except that the squad takes one additional step to ensure that the pivot foot is in the\\ncorrect position to execute the movement.\\nNotes. 1. When there are only three squads in the column, the first squad takes two steps before\\nexecuting.\\n2. When the platoon leader and platoon sergeant are marching at their posts as part of a larger\\nformation, the platoon leader takes three steps forward and executes a column right, marches\\nacross the front of the platoon, executes another column right (just beyond fourth squad), marches\\nto their post in the most direct manner, takes up the Half Step, and then steps off with a 30-inch\\nstep when the squad leaders come on line. The platoon sergeant inclines to the right, follows the\\nthird squad until the movement is completed, and then resumes their post.\\nMARCHING TO THE FLANKS\\n7-49. The platoon may be marched to the flank (for short distances only) when marching in column. The\\ncommand for this movement is Right (Left) Flank, MARCH. The preparatory command is given as the foot\\nin the desired direction strikes the marching surface, and the command of execution is given the next time\\nthe foot in the desired direction strikes the marching surface. On the command of execution MARCH, all\\nmembers take one more step, pivot 90 degrees in the commanded direction on the ball of the lead foot, and\\nstep off in the new direction with the trailing foot. As the members begin to march in the new direction, they\\nglance out of the corner of their right eyes and dress to the right.\\nFORMING A FILE AND RE-FORMING\\n7-50. The platoon forms a single file, from the right, left, or as designated, only when in column and at the\\nHalt. The commands are File from the left (right), MARCH or File in sequence three-two-four-one,\\nMARCH.\\nNote. If the squad\u2019s direction of travel is to the left, or the squad is immediately following an\\nelement on the left, then all supplementary commands will be given over the left shoulder. If the\\nsquad\u2019s direction of travel is forward or to the right, or is immediately following a squad on the\\nright, all supplementary commands will be given over the right shoulder. The squad leaders give\\nthe appropriate command so that they are following the last Soldier in the preceding squad at the\\ncorrect distance.\\n7-51. On the preparatory command, the squad leader of the designated squad gives the supplementary\\ncommand Forward. The other squad leaders command STAND FAST. On the command of execution\\nMARCH (given by the platoon sergeant), the lead squad marches forward. The squad leader next to the lead\\nelement (or as designated) looks over the shoulder nearest the moving element and commands Column Half\\nLeft (Right) when the second from the last Soldier is abreast of them and their right foot strikes the marching\\nsurface. The squad leader gives the command of execution MARCH as the right foot of the last Soldier\\nstrikes the marching surface when abreast of them. On the command of execution, the squad leader executes\\nthe Column Half Left (Right), then inclines without command to the right (left) and follows the last Soldier\\nof the preceding squad at correct distance. Other members of the squad march forward and execute the same\\nmovements as the squad leader. The remaining squads form the file in the same manner as the squad\\nimmediately behind the lead element.\\n7-52. The platoon may form a file and execute a column movement simultaneously from a column formation.\\nThe command for this movement is File from the left (right), Column Left (Right), MARCH. Following\\nthe platoon sergeant\u2019s preparatory command, the squad leader of the lead element commands Column Left\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 7-11Chapter 7\\n(Right), instead of Forward. The other squad leaders command STAND FAST. On the platoon leader\u2019s\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the lead squad executes the Column Left (Right). The other squad leaders\\ncommand Column Left (Right) (when the second from the last person is abreast of them) and then gives the\\ncommand of execution MARCH as the right foot of the last person strikes the marching surface abreast of\\nthem.\\nNotes. 1. At this point, the platoon is executing platoon drill. The platoon sergeant will not release\\ncontrol of the squads to the squad leaders. The platoon sergeant will rest personnel on an as needed\\nbasis; for example, when filing into a building.\\n2.The squad leaders give the command of execution MARCH as the right foot of the last Soldier\\nstrikes the marching surface at the pivot (Column Left), or the first time the last Soldier\u2019s right\\nfoot strikes the marching surface after the pivot (Column Right).\\n7-53. The platoon re-forms to the original column formation only from the Halt. The command is Column\\nof fours to the right (left), MARCH:\\nNote. To re-form the platoon to its original column formation when the file was formed on the\\ncommand In Sequence, MARCH, the commands FALL OUT and FALL IN must be given.\\n\\uf06c On the preparatory command, the squad leader of the base squad commands STAND FAST. All\\nother squad leaders command Column Half Right (Left). On the platoon sergeant\u2019s command of\\nexecution MARCH, the base squad stands fast; all other squads execute the Column Half Right\\n(Left) simultaneously.\\n\\uf06c As each of the moving squad leaders reach a point (line) that ensures correct interval on the\\nelement to their left (right), they automatically incline to the left (right) and command Mark Time,\\nMARCH and Squad, HALT so that their squad is abreast of the base (other) squad when halted.\\nFORMING A COLUMN OF TWOS AND RE-FORMING\\n7-54. The platoon forms a column of twos from the right or left when in a column of fours at the Halt. The\\ncommand is Column of twos from the left (right), MARCH:\\n\\uf06c On the preparatory command, the squad leaders of the two lead squads command Forward. The\\nother squad leaders command STAND FAST:\\n\\uf0a7 On the platoon sergeant\u2019s command of execution MARCH, the two lead squads march\\nforward. The squad leader (second or third) next to the lead element gives the command to\\nstart both remaining squads in motion. Looking over the shoulder nearest the moving\\nelements, the squad leader gives the preparatory command Column Half Left (Right) (when\\nthe second from the last Soldier is abreast of them) and then gives the command of execution\\nMARCH as the right foot of the last Soldier strikes the marching surface abreast of them.\\n\\uf0a7 On the platoon sergeant\u2019s command of execution, both squad leaders execute the Column\\nHalf Left (Right), incline to the right (left) without command, and follow the last Soldiers of\\nthe preceding squads at correct distance (do not close the space if the files of the two leading\\nsquads are uneven). Other members of the remaining squads march forward and execute the\\nsame movements as their squad leaders.\\n\\uf06c The platoon may form a column of twos and execute a column movement simultaneously from a\\ncolumn formation. The command for this movement is Column of twos from the left (right),\\nColumn left (right), MARCH:\\n\\uf0a7 The squad leaders of the lead squads command Column Left (Right) instead of Forward. The\\nsquad leader of the second (third) squad gives the command Column Left (Right); however,\\nthey execute Column Half Left (Right). The remaining two squad leaders command STAND\\nFAST.\\n7-12 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Platoon Drill\\n\\uf0a7 On the platoon sergeant\u2019s command of execution MARCH, the lead squads execute the\\nColumn Left (Right). The squad leader (second or third) next to the lead elements gives the\\ncommand to start both squads in motion. Looking over the shoulder nearest the moving\\nelements, the squad leader gives the preparatory command Column Left (Right) when the\\nsecond from the last Soldier is abreast of them. Then they give the command of execution\\nMARCH as the right foot of the last Soldier strikes the marching surface at the pivot (Column\\nLeft) or the first time the last Soldier\u2019s right foot strikes the marching surface after the pivot\\n(Column Right). Although the command is Column Left (Right), the outside squads (fourth\\nor first) execute Column Half Left (Right).\\n\\uf06c The platoon re-forms to the original column formation only from the Halt. The command is\\nColumn of fours to the right (left), MARCH:\\n\\uf0a7 When re-forming into a column of fours without the platoon leader present, the platoon\\nsergeant remains at their post centered on the platoon. When re-forming into a column of\\nfours with the platoon leader present, the platoon leader faces as in marching and resumes\\ntheir original position in the column. The platoon sergeant follows the rear element and\\nresumes their post in the formation when the element has halted.\\n\\uf0a7 On the preparatory command, the squad leaders of the base squads command STAND FAST.\\nThe trailing squad leaders command Column Half Right (Left). On the platoon sergeant\u2019s\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the base squads stand fast. The trailing squad leaders\\nexecute slightly more than the Column Half Right (Left) simultaneously. As the trailing squad\\nleaders reach a point (line) that will ensure correct interval on the element to their left (right),\\nthey automatically incline to the left (right). The squad leader nearest the stationary squads\\n(second or third) commands Mark Time, MARCH and Squads, HALT.\\nSECTION III \u2013 INSPECTIONS\\n7-55. Inspections at platoon level are typically conducted by the platoon sergeant. If the platoon leader wants\\nto inspect, they conduct the inspection from their post. For continuity purposes, this section will address the\\nplatoon sergeant\u2019s actions only.\\nBASIC INFORMATION\\n7-56. The platoon has one prescribed formation for inspecting personnel and equipment in ranks\u2014the line\\nformation. When inspecting crew-served weapons and vehicles, the personnel are normally positioned to the\\nrear of the formation with the operator (gunner) standing by their vehicle (weapon). Typically, the platoons\\nare inspected by the platoon sergeants; however, they may be inspected by the first sergeant or company\\ncommander.\\n7-57. The platoon leader or platoon sergeant may conduct an in-quarters (barracks) inspection to include\\npersonal appearance, individual weapons, field equipment, displays, maintenance, and sanitary conditions.\\nThe platoon leader or platoon sergeant will follow local guidelines.\\n7-58. When field equipment is to be inspected, it should be displayed neatly, organized, and serviceable.\\nAdditional equipment or different models of the equipment should be arranged in a uniform manner\\nestablished by the local commander. The squad leaders may carry and use materials to record deficiencies if\\nthe local chain of command authorizes it.\\nIN-RANKS INSPECTION\\n7-59. To conduct in-ranks inspections, put the platoon use the following procedures in a line formation, the\\nplatoon sergeant commands Count, OFF. On the command of execution OFF, all personnel except right\\nflank personnel turn their heads and eyes to the right and the right flank personnel count off with \u201cONE.\u201d\\nAfter the right flank Soldiers have counted their number, the Soldiers to their left count off with the next\\nhigher number and simultaneously turn their heads and eyes to the front. All other members of the formation\\ncount off in the same manner until the entire formation has counted off.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 7-13Chapter 7\\n7-60. After the platoon has counted off, the platoon sergeant commands Open Ranks, MARCH. On the\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the front rank takes two steps forward, the second rank takes one step\\nforward, the third rank stands fast, and the fourth rank takes two steps backward. If additional ranks are\\npresent, the fifth rank takes four steps backward, and the sixth rank takes six steps backward.\\nNote. After taking the prescribed number of steps, the Soldiers do not raise their arms. If the\\nplatoon leader wants exact interval or alignment, they command At Close Interval (At Double\\nInterval), Dress Right, DRESS. (See paragraph 7-28 for more information on aligning the\\nplatoon.)\\n7-61. At this point, the platoon is ready to be inspected. Typically, the squads are inspected by the squad\\nleaders; however they may be inspected by the platoon sergeant or platoon leader.\\nSQUAD LEADERS\u2019 INSPECTION\\n7-62. If the platoon sergeant wants the squad leaders to inspect their squads, they will direct INSPECT\\nYOUR SQUADS. Salutes are not exchanged.\\n7-63. The squad leaders face to the half left as in marching and march by the most direct route to a point\\n15 inches in front of and centered on the first Soldier.\\nNote. If the members of the platoon are armed, the squad leaders will sling their weapons\\ndiagonally across the back with the muzzle down and to the right. This movement will be executed\\nwithout command and prior to the squad leader stepping off.\\n7-64. The squad leaders remain at a modified Position of Attention moving their heads and eyes only. After\\ninspecting at the center position, they take a short step forward and to the left and inspects, return to the center\\nand step forward and to the right and inspect, and return to the center position.\\n7-65. Having inspected the first Soldier, the squad leader faces to the right as in marching and takes one (two\\nif at normal interval) step, halts, and faces the next Soldier at the appropriate distance. The squad leader\\nconducts the inspection for the rest of the Soldiers in the squad.\\n7-66. After inspecting the last Soldier in the squad, the squad leader faces to the right as in marching and\\nmarches around behind the squad, inclining as necessary. While the squad leader marches back to their post,\\nthey inspect the squad from the rear.\\n7-67. After resuming their post, the squad leader turns their head and eyes over their left shoulder and\\ncommands their squad to assume At Ease. The platoon sergeant remains at their post (inspects the guidon or\\nphase bearer as appropriate). After the last squad has been inspected and is at At Ease, the platoon sergeant\\ncommands the platoon to Attention.\\n7-68. After commanding the platoon to Attention, the platoon sergeant commands Close Ranks, MARCH.\\nOn the command of execution MARCH, the first rank takes four steps backward, the second rank takes two\\nsteps backward, the third rank stands fast, and the fourth rank takes one step forward. On the command of\\nexecution MARCH, the platoon leader and platoon sergeant take the appropriate number of steps to maintain\\ntheir posts.\\n7-69. If the platoon is being inspected as part of a larger formation and control of the platoon has not been\\nturned over to the platoon sergeant, they face about, and execute At Ease. They then wait on further\\ninstructions from the first sergeant.\\nPLATOON SERGEANT\u2019S OR PLATOON LEADER\u2019S INSPECTION\\n7-70. If the platoon sergeant is not going to inspect the entire platoon, they direct the squad leaders of the\\nappropriate squads to inspect their squads. All others will be inspected by the platoon sergeant. When armed,\\nthe platoon sergeant slings their weapon in the same manner as the squad leaders.\\n7-14 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Platoon Drill\\n7-71. The platoon sergeant faces to the Half Left as in marching and marches by the most direct route to a\\npoint 15 inches in front of and centered on the first squad leader (or the squad leader of the squad to be\\ninspected). As soon as the platoon sergeant halts in front of the squad leader, they command the other squads\\nto At Ease and inspect the squad leader.\\n7-72. The platoon sergeant remains at a modified Position of Attention moving their head and eyes only.\\nAfter inspecting at the center position, they take a short step forward and to the left and inspect, return to the\\ncenter and step forward and to the right and inspect, and return to the center position.\\n7-73. Having inspected the squad leader, the platoon sergeant faces to the right as in marching and takes one\\n(two if at normal interval) steps, halts, and faces the next Soldier at the appropriate distance. After the platoon\\nsergeant steps off, the squad leader takes a half step forward and faces about. When moving from Soldier to\\nSoldier, the squad leader and platoon sergeant move simultaneously.\\n7-74. Having inspected the last Soldier in the squad, the platoon sergeant faces to the right as in marching\\nand marches around behind the squad, inclining as necessary. The platoon sergeant inspects the squad from\\nthe rear.\\n7-75. As the platoon sergeant begins to inspect the first squad from the rear, the second squad leader\\ncommands their squad to Attention. The first squad leader returns to their post. After the platoon sergeant\\narrives in front of the second squad leader, the platoon sergeant commands the first squad to At Ease over\\ntheir right shoulder. All remaining squads will be inspected in the same manner as the first.\\n7-76. The platoon sergeant and squad leader execute in the same manner as in inspecting the first squad until\\nthe entire platoon has been inspected. After inspecting the rear of the last squad, the platoon sergeant marches\\nby the most direct route to their post, halts, faces to the left and commands the platoon to Attention.\\n7-77. After commanding the platoon to Attention, the platoon sergeant commands Close Ranks, MARCH.\\nOn the command of execution MARCH, the first rank takes four steps backward, the second rank takes two\\nsteps backward, the third rank stands fast, and the fourth rank takes one step forward. On the command of\\nexecution MARCH, the platoon leader and platoon sergeant take the appropriate number of steps to maintain\\ntheir posts.\\n7-78. If the platoon is being inspected as part of a larger formation and control of the platoon has been not\\nbeen turned over to the platoon sergeant, they face about and execute At Ease. They then await further\\ninstructions from the first sergeant.\\nIN-QUARTERS (STAND BY) INSPECTION\\n7-79. When the platoon sergeant wants to conduct an in-quarters inspection, they position the squad members\\non line with their equipment or as near it as possible. The squad leader positions themselves in the path of\\nthe inspector at a point near their area of responsibility. At the approach of the inspector, the squad leader\\ncommands, Squad, ATTENTION and reports, \u201cSergeant, the platoon is prepared for inspection.\u201d\\nNote. When the situation dictates, the squad leader may report to the inspector outside of the\\nquarters. A designated individual commands the members to ATTENTION as the inspector\\nenters the area.\\n7-80. The squad leader then guides the inspector along a route dictated by the physical arrangement of the\\npersonnel and equipment. Upon entering the area, the highest ranking Soldier present commands AT EASE.\\nAs the inspector approaches each individual or their equipment, the individual automatically assumes the\\nPosition of Attention. When the inspector has moved to the next Soldier, the last Soldier inspected resumes\\nthe position of At Ease. As the inspector begins to exit the area after completing the inspection, CARRY ON\\nis commanded.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 7-15Chapter 7\\nNote. When inspecting Soldiers\u2019 rooms, Attention is not commanded. The individuals\\nautomatically assume the Position of Attention as the inspector enters the room. The inspector then\\ncommands AT EASE. As the inspector approaches each Soldier, the Soldier assumes the Position\\nof Attention and resumes At Ease after they have been inspected.\\n7-16 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Chapter 8\\nCompany Drill\\n\u201cThe fundamentals of drill are established daily.... If these maneuvers are all\\naccurately observed and practiced every day then the army will remain virtually\\nundefeatable and always awe inspiring\u2026.\u201d\\nFrederick the Great: \u201cHistory of My Own Times,\u201d\\ntranslated to English in 1789\\nSECTION I \u2013 PROCEDURES AND PERSONNEL\\n8-1. The procedures used and personnel required to conduct company drill are described in this section.\\nBASIC INFORMATION\\n8-2. The following bullets discuss basic information that applies to conducting company drill:\\n\\uf06c Individual drill movements, manual of arms, and squad and platoon drills are executed as\\npreviously described in chapters 4 through 7 while conducting company drill.\\n\\uf06c For the most part, company drill provides the procedures for executing platoon drill in conjunction\\nwith other platoons in the same formation.\\n\\uf06c For drill purposes, a company consists of a company headquarters and two or more platoons. The\\ncompany headquarters personnel are attached to the platoons to equalize platoon strength without\\ninterfering with the permanent squad organization; however, the commander may form the\\nheadquarters personnel into a separate platoon at either flank of the company. When headquarters\\npersonnel form as a separate element, the senior sergeant serves as the platoon sergeant, and the\\ncompany executive officer serves as the platoon leader.\\n\\uf06c When in a line or a mass formation, the right platoon serves as the base; when in a column\\nformation, the lead platoon serves as the base.\\n\\uf06c The company may be formed by the commander and the platoon leaders or the first sergeant and\\nthe platoon sergeants. If the commander is not scheduled to receive or inspect the company, the\\nfirst sergeant and platoon sergeants remain at their posts and execute company drill from their\\nposts. For continuity purposes, the term \u201cfirst sergeant\u201d may be used to denote \u201ccommander,\u201d just\\nas \u201cplatoon sergeant\u201d may be used to denote \u201cplatoon leader\u201d when the first sergeant and platoon\\nsergeants are conducting company drill from their posts.\\n\\uf06c When the first sergeant directs that the company open or close ranks, align, stack or take arms,\\nextend march, close on the leading platoon, or prepare for inspection, the movements are executed\\non the command of the platoon sergeants and not on the directives of the first sergeant. The platoon\\nsergeants command the movement in sequence beginning with the base platoon.\\n\\uf06c During all drills and ceremonies, the first sergeant and executive officer carry their weapons at\\nSling Arms. They remain at Sling Arms during all manual of arms movements except when they\\nexecute the Hand Salute while at Sling Arms.\\n\\uf06c The members of a company break ranks in the same manner as in platoon drill except that the\\nindividuals called from the formation form on the first sergeant rather than on the platoon sergeant.\\n\\uf06c The company marches, rests, and executes Eyes Right in the same manner as the platoon.\\n\\uf06c The company has four prescribed formations: company in line with platoons in line; company in\\ncolumn with platoons in column; company in column with platoons in line (used primarily for\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 8-1Chapter 8\\nceremonies); and company mass formation. However, the company may be formed into a column\\nof twos in the same manner as the platoon.\\nPOSTS FOR KEY PERSONNEL\\n8-3. Key personnel assume their posts as follows:\\n\\uf06c Company commander. The company commander\u2019s post is normally 12 steps in front of the front\\nrank of troops and centered on the company as seen in figure 8-1. The only exceptions to this rule\\nare when the company forms as part of a larger unit in a column formation (with the company and\\nplatoons in column) or when the company is formed in a mass formation. In these situations, the\\ncompany commander\u2019s post is 6 steps in front of and centered on the front rank of troops and 12\\nsteps behind the last rank of troops of the element to their front as seen in figure 8-2 on page 8-5.\\n\\uf06c Guidon bearer. The guidon bearer\u2019s post is two 15-inch steps to the rear and two 15-inch steps to\\nthe left of the company commander (see figure 8-1). (The manual of the guidon is discussed in\\nfurther detail in appendix F.)\\n8-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Company Drill\\nFigure 8-1. Company in line with platoons in line\\nNote. The company commander should inconspicuously direct the guidon bearer to remain in\\nposition and move with the commander when the company is to be faced to the right and marched\\nfor only a short distance.\\n\\uf06c Executive officer. When the company is in a line formation, the executive officer\u2019s post is two\\nsteps to the rear of the first sergeant; in a column or a mass formation, they are three steps to the\\nrear of the last rank and off center (one 15-inch step to the right) of the company.\\n\\uf06c Platoon leaders. When the company is in a line formation with the platoons in line, the post for\\nthe platoon leader is six steps in front of and centered on the platoon. When the company is in\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 8-3Chapter 8\\ncolumn formation with the platoons in column or the company is in column with the platoons in\\nline, the post for the platoon leader is one step in front of and centered on the platoon. When the\\ncompany is in mass formation, the post for the platoon leaders is one step in front of and evenly\\nspaced across the company front. If the commander is not present, the platoon leaders are not part\\nof the formation.\\n\\uf06c First sergeant. When the company is in a line formation, the first sergeant\u2019s post is three steps to\\nthe rear of the last rank and centered on the company; in a column or a mass formation, they are\\nthree steps to the rear of the last rank and off center (one 15-inch step to the left) of the company\\n(see figure 8-2):\\n\\uf0a7 When the company is in mass formation, without the commander present, the post for the first\\nsergeant is five steps in front of and centered on the formation. When the company is in a line\\nformation with the platoons in a line without the commander present, the post for the first\\nsergeant is nine steps in front of and centered on the company. When the company is in a\\ncolumn formation with the platoons in a column without the commander present, the post for\\nthe first sergeant is nine steps to the left flank of and centered on the company.\\n\\uf0a7 When marching the company in mass formation with the commander at their post, the first\\nsergeant remains at their post to provide cadence and control.\\n\\uf06c Platoon sergeant. When the company is in any of the four formations and the officers are present,\\nthe platoon sergeant\u2019s post is one step to the rear and centered on their platoon:\\n\\uf0a7 When the company is in mass formation, the post for the platoon sergeants is one step to the\\nrear of the company and evenly spaced across the frontage. When the company is in mass\\nformation, Without the Officers Present, the post for the platoon sergeants is one step in front\\nof and evenly spaced across the front.\\n\\uf0a7 When the company is in a line formation with the platoons in a line Without the Officers\\nPresent, the post for the platoon sergeant is three steps in front of and centered on their\\nplatoon. When the company is in column formation with the platoons in column Without the\\nOfficers Present, the post for the platoon sergeant is three steps to the left flank of and centered\\non their platoon.\\n\\uf0a7 When marching the company Without the Officers Present, and the company is in column\\nformation with the platoons in column, the platoon sergeants remain at their posts and provide\\nfor cadence and control of their platoons.\\n\\uf06c Additional officers. Other officers assigned or attached, who have no prescribed position within\\nthe formation, form evenly to the right and left of the executive officer in a line formation; they\\nfall out and form in one or two ranks at correct distance to the rear of the first sergeant and\\nexecutive officer when the company forms in column (see figure 8-4 on page 8-7).\\n8-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Company Drill\\nFigure 8-2. Company in column with platoons in column\\n8-4. The executive officer inconspicuously gives the necessary commands (March, Column Half Left, Halt,\\nand Facings) for themselves and the first sergeant when changing from one post to another. Once in motion,\\nthey incline as necessary and march to their new posts. When the company changes from a line formation to\\na column formation, the first sergeant and executive officer face with the company but do not march forward.\\nThey remain in position until the last platoon has passed. If the company marches forward (column formation)\\nfor a short distance only, or if it closes on the base platoon (line formation) at close interval, the first sergeant\\nand executive officer march forward or face to the right in marching and resume their posts. When the\\ncompany changes from a column (platoons in column) to a line formation, it faces to the right in marching\\nand assumes the posts in line. When the company forms a company in column with platoons in line, as the\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 8-5Chapter 8\\nunit is faced, it faces to the right in marching and assumes the posts to the rear of the last platoon. When the\\ncompany is formed in mass, it faces to the right in marching and assumes the posts at the center of the\\ncompany immediately after halting with the last platoon (see figure 8-3). The off-center position explained\\nfor the first sergeant and executive officer should place them at normal interval from each other while\\ncovering a file to their front. If either one is not present during a formation, the one present changes posts\\nwithout command and assumes the post at the center of the company rather than off center (see figure 8-4).\\nFigure 8-3. Company in mass\\n8-6 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Company Drill\\nFigure 8-4. Company in column with platoons in line\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 8-7Chapter 8\\nSECTION II \u2013 FORMATIONS AND MOVEMENTS\\n8-5. This section discusses the formations and movements used in conducting a company drill.\\nBASIC INFORMATION\\n8-6. This paragraph discusses basic information that applies to the formations and movements used in\\nconducting a company drill:\\n\\uf06c The company normally forms in a line formation; however, it may re-form in column when each\\nSoldier can identify their exact position (equipment grounded) in the formation.\\n\\uf06c The company forms basically the same as the platoon. On the command fall in; (At Close Interval),\\nFALL IN, the platoons form in line, centered on and facing the person forming the unit, with\\nfive-step intervals between platoons.\\nNote. To have the company assemble in a company mass formation, the command is Mass\\nFormation, FALL IN. Before giving the commands, the person forming the unit announces the\\ninterval and the number of personnel in the front and designates the base person. In this situation,\\nthe first sergeant and platoon sergeants travel around the right flank of the formation when moving\\nfrom post to post. The commander and platoon leaders travel around the left flank of the formation\\nwhen moving from post to post.\\n\\uf06c When armed, members fall in at Order (Sling) Arms. For safety, the person forming the unit\\ncommands Inspection, ARMS; Ready, Port, ARMS; Order (Sling), ARMS at the initial\\nformation of the day, or when the last command is DISMISSED.\\n\\uf06c The company may be formed by the first sergeant and platoon sergeants or by the company\\ncommander and platoon leaders. When possible, the platoons assemble near the formation site\\nbefore the arrival of the first sergeant or company commander. If the company is formed by the\\nNCOs, the platoon leaders normally observe the procedures from a position to the rear of their\\nplatoons.\\n\\uf06c When the company is formed by the NCOs, the following procedures apply:\\n\\uf0a7 The first sergeant posts themselves nine steps in front of (center) and facing the line where\\nthe front rank of each platoon is to form. They then command fall in; (At Close Interval),\\nFALL IN.\\n\\uf0a7 On the command of execution, the platoons form in the same manner prescribed in platoon\\ndrill. Each platoon sergeant faces their platoon while the platoons are forming and directs\\ntheir platoon to adjust (if necessary) and align on the platoon to its right at the correct interval\\n(as described in paragraph 8-8). Once the platoon is formed, the platoon sergeants face about.\\nNote. If the command At Close Interval, FALL IN is given, the members of the platoon form at\\nclose interval; however, the five-step interval between platoons is maintained.\\n\\uf0a7 When all platoon sergeants are facing to the front, the first sergeant commands (if appropriate)\\nInspection, ARMS; Ready, Port, ARMS; Order (Sling), ARMS. The first sergeant then\\ndirects (if appropriate) RECEIVE THE REPORT. The platoon sergeants face about and\\ncommand REPORT. The squad leaders report (as described in chapter 7). Having received\\nthe report, the platoon sergeants face about. When all platoon sergeants are facing to the front,\\nthe first sergeant commands REPORT. The platoon sergeants turn their heads and eyes\\ntoward the first sergeant, salute and report (as described in chapter 7) in succession from right\\nto left. The first sergeant turns their head and eyes toward the reporting platoon sergeant and\\nreturns each Salute individually. Having received the report from the platoon sergeants, the\\nfirst sergeant faces about and awaits the arrival of the company commander if the commander\\nis scheduled to receive the company.\\n8-8 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Company Drill\\nNote. If the commander is not scheduled to receive or inspect the company, the first sergeant and\\nplatoon sergeants remain at their posts and execute company drill from their posts. For continuity\\npurposes, the term \u201ccommander\u201d may also be used to denote the first sergeant, just as \u201cplatoon\\nleader\u201d may be used to denote the platoon sergeant when the commander and platoon leaders are\\nconducting company drill from their posts.\\n\\uf0a7 When the company commander has halted at their post, the first sergeant salutes and reports,\\n\u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, all present,\u201d or \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, all accounted for,\u201d or \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, (so\\nmany) Soldiers absent.\u201d The company commander returns the Salute and commands POST.\\nThe first sergeant faces about and marches to their post three steps to the rear and at the center\\nof the company, halts, and faces about. The guidon bearer steps forward three steps. The\\nplatoon sergeants face to the right in marching and assume their posts to the rear of their\\nplatoons (if the platoon leader is not present, they step forward three steps). The platoon\\nleaders march around the left flank of their platoons and assume their posts by inclining facing\\nto the front. The company executive officer assumes their post two steps to the rear of the first\\nsergeant.\\n\\uf06c When the company is formed by the company commander, the procedures are the same as forming\\nwith the NCOs except that the platoon leaders form their platoons and the first sergeant, platoon\\nsergeants, and guidon bearer fall in at their posts (see figure 8-1 on page 8-3). The command\\nPOST is not necessary. If a platoon sergeant is to fill the post of platoon leader, they take a position\\nsix steps in front of and centered on the platoon.\\nCHANGING INTERVAL\\n8-7. The company changes interval in the same manner as prescribed for the platoon:\\n\\uf06c When the first sergeant wants the company to obtain close interval in a line formation while\\nmaintaining a five-step interval, they direct CLOSE ON THE BASE PLATOON AT CLOSE\\nINTERVAL. The platoon sergeants face about and command Count, OFF. After the platoons\\nhave counted off, the platoon sergeants command Close Interval, MARCH. The second, third,\\nand fourth platoon sergeants command Right, FACE and in succession command Half Step,\\nMARCH. They halt at the five-step interval and face the platoon to the left. If the directive\\nCLOSE ON THE THIRD PLATOON AT CLOSE INTERVAL is given, the platoon sergeants\\non the right of the designated platoon have their platoons obtain close interval, face their platoons\\nto the left, march (Half Step) forward until the five-step interval is obtained, and then halt and face\\ntheir platoons to the right.\\nNote. When the company is at close interval (line formation), the first sergeant may march the\\ncompany (in column with less than correct distance) at the Half Step for short distances. If the\\nfirst sergeant wants to march with a 30-inch step while marching with less than correct distance,\\nthey command Extend, MARCH. The first platoon sergeant commands Extend, MARCH. The\\nother platoon sergeants command CONTINUE TO MARCH. As the first platoon begins to\\nmarch with a 30-inch step, the second platoon sergeant commands Extend, MARCH. The\\nremaining platoons execute the directive in the same manner as the second platoon.\\n\\uf06c When the first sergeant wants the company to obtain normal interval from close interval in a line\\nformation while maintaining a five-step interval, they direct EXTEND ON THE BASE\\nPLATOON AT NORMAL INTERVAL. The platoon sergeants face about and march (Half\\nStep) their platoons to a position that ensures the five-step interval between platoons after they\\nhave obtained normal interval. After halting and facing the platoons to the left, the platoon\\nsergeants command Count, OFF. The platoon sergeants then command Normal Interval,\\nMARCH. If necessary, the platoon sergeant can verify the interval as described in the note of\\nparagraph 8-8.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 8-9Chapter 8\\nCHANGING DISTANCE\\n8-8. To increase the distance between elements of a company (or larger unit) while marching in column to\\nnormal distance, use the following procedures:\\nNote. This movement is only executed from the half step when a company or larger-size element\\nis marching in column at less than normal distance.\\n\\uf06c To increase the distance between elements of a company (or larger unit) while marching in column\\nat the half step to normal distance, the command is Extend, MARCH. On the preparatory\\ncommand Extend of Extend, MARCH, the platoon sergeant echoes the preparatory command\\nand all subsequent platoon sergeants issue the supplementary command CONTINUE TO\\nMARCH. On the command of execution MARCH of Extend, MARCH, the front rank of the\\nlead element takes one more 15-inch step, then steps off with a 30-inch step. All other ranks\\ncontinue to march with a 15-inch step until the rank to their front has stepped off with a 30-inch\\nstep and has obtained normal distance (40 inches).\\n\\uf06c Subsequent platoon sergeants issue the command Extend, MARCH after the entire element to\\ntheir front has obtained normal distance and has begun marching forward with a 30-inch step.\\nNote. From the Halt, the first sergeant directs HAVE YOUR PLATOONS EXTEND MARCH.\\nThe lead platoon sergeant gives the command Extend, MARCH. All subsequent platoon sergeants\\ngive the command Half Step, MARCH. On the command of execution MARCH of Extend,\\nMARCH, the front rank steps off with a 30-inch step. All other ranks step off with a 15-inch step\\nand execute the movement in the same manner as previously described in paragraph 8-6.\\nALIGNING THE COMPANY\\n8-9. To align the company, use the following procedures:\\n\\uf06c To align the company in a line formation, the first sergeant directs HAVE YOUR PLATOONS\\nDRESS RIGHT:\\n\\uf0a7 On the directive, all platoon sergeants face about. The right flank platoon sergeant commands\\nDress Right, DRESS and aligns their platoon as described in platoon drill. When the\\nalignment of the first rank of the right platoon has been verified (the platoon sergeant has\\nstepped off to align the second rank), the platoon sergeant to the left commands Dress Right,\\nDRESS. They then face to the half right in marching, moves to a position on line with and\\none step to the left of the left flank Soldier of the first rank, and face (Left Face) down the\\nline.\\n\\uf0a7 After aligning the first rank, the platoon sergeant centers themselves on the first rank, faces\\nto the right in marching, takes two short steps, halts, executes Left Face, and aligns the second\\nrank. The third and fourth ranks are aligned in the same manner as the second rank.\\n\\uf0a7 After aligning the fourth rank, the platoon sergeant faces to the left in marching; returns to\\ntheir position, center of the platoon; halts perpendicular to the formation; faces to the right;\\ncommands Ready, FRONT; and faces about. All platoon sergeants to the left of the second\\nplatoon take the same actions as the second platoon sergeant.\\nNote. If necessary, the platoon sergeants to the left of the base platoon command VERIFY\\nINTERVAL before commanding Dress Right, DRESS. On the command VERIFY\\nINTERVAL, the base (squad leader of the first squad) faces to the right in marching and moves\\nto the left flank member (first squad) of the platoon to the right, halts, faces about, steps forward\\nfive steps, halts, faces to the right, and aligns themselves on the element to their right.\\n\\uf06c To align the company in column, the first sergeant directs HAVE YOUR PLATOONS COVER.\\nOn this directive, the first platoon sergeant faces about and commands COVER. The other platoon\\n8-10 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Company Drill\\nsergeants command STAND FAST. The first platoon covers as in platoon drill. The other platoons\\nthen execute the movement in succession as soon as the platoon to their front has completed the\\nmovement.\\nOPENING AND CLOSING RANKS\\n8-10. To Open Ranks, the first sergeant directs HAVE YOUR PLATOONS OPEN RANKS AND DRESS\\nRIGHT. On the directive, all platoon sergeants face about. The right flank platoon sergeant commands Open\\nRanks, MARCH. When the platoon has completed the movement, they then command Dress Right, DRESS\\nand aligns the platoon the same as in platoon drill. When the first rank of the right platoon has been aligned,\\nthe platoon sergeant to the left commands Open Ranks, MARCH and then commands Dress Right, DRESS.\\nThen they align their platoon in the same manner described in paragraphs 7-28 and 8-8. All platoon sergeants\\nto the left of the second platoon take the same actions as the second platoon sergeant.\\nNote. When clearing grounded equipment, the company may march in column (Right FACE)\\nfrom open ranks (Double Interval) for short distances. Having cleared the equipment, the first\\nsergeant commands Normal Interval, MARCH. When returning to the equipment while marching\\nat normal interval, the command Double Interval, MARCH is given. If the company is marching\\nin reverse order, the commands FALL OUT and FALL IN should be given.\\n8-11. To Close Ranks, the first sergeant directs HAVE YOUR PLATOONS CLOSE RANKS. On the\\ndirective, all platoon sergeants face about and in sequence from right to left command Close Ranks,\\nMARCH. The platoons execute the movement the same as in platoon drill. After the platoons have completed\\nthe movement, the platoon sergeants face about.\\nCHANGING THE DIRECTION OF MARCH OF A COLUMN\\n8-12. To change the direction of march of a column, use the following procedures:\\n\\uf06c The company changes the direction of march basically the same as the squad and platoon. The\\ncommands are Column Right (Left), Column Half Right (Left), MARCH.\\n\\uf06c The base element during a column movement is the lead platoon and the squad on the flank, in the\\ndirection of turn.\\n\\uf06c When at the Halt, the leading platoon sergeant repeats the first sergeant\u2019s preparatory command.\\nSucceeding platoon sergeants give the supplementary command Forward. On the command of\\nexecution MARCH, the leading platoon executes the movement as described in platoon drill;\\nsucceeding platoons execute the movement on their platoon sergeant\u2019s command at approximately\\nthe same location.\\n\\uf06c While marching, the movement is executed as described from the Halt except that the succeeding\\nplatoon sergeants give the supplementary command Continue to March rather than Forward.\\n\\uf06c The company executes Rear March and inclines in the same manner as the platoon.\\n\\uf06c When executing Counter-Column March from the Halt, the leading platoon sergeant repeats the\\npreparatory command. Succeeding platoon sergeants give the supplementary command Forward:\\n\\uf0a7 On the command of execution MARCH, the leading platoon executes the movement as\\ndescribed in platoon drill and marches through the other platoons. Succeeding platoons\\nexecute the movement on the platoon sergeant\u2019s command at approximately the same\\nlocation.\\n\\uf0a7 When the movement is executed while marching, the command of execution is given as the\\nleft foot strikes the marching surface. The movement is executed basically the same as from\\nthe Halt except that the succeeding platoon sergeants give the supplementary command\\nContinue to March rather than Forward.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 8-11Chapter 8\\n\\uf0a7 The guidon bearer faces to the left in marching from the Halt or executes a Column Left in\\nmarching, marches by the most direct route outside of the formation, and repositions\\nthemselves in front of the lead platoon as it clears the rear of the company.\\n\\uf0a7 If the first sergeant gives the command from their post in a separate unit, they move in the\\nmost convenient manner to their new position at the left flank of the unit. If they give the\\ncommand while at the head of the company, they move in the same direction as the guidon\\nbearer.\\nCLOSING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN PLATOONS\\n8-13. This movement is only executed when the company is in column with the platoons in column. The\\nformation has been faced to the right for marching with the first sergeant and platoon sergeants at their posts.\\n8-14. The first sergeant directs CLOSE ON THE LEADING PLATOON. The leading platoon sergeant\\ncommands STAND FAST. The leading platoon sergeant then faces to the left as in marching and marches,\\ninclining as necessary, to the trail of the company.\\n8-15. The succeeding platoon\u2019s platoon sergeant marches their platoon forward and commands Mark Time,\\nMARCH. They ensure that they give the command of execution MARCH when the squad leaders are three\\nsteps from the last Soldier in the leading platoon so that the Soldiers of the succeeding platoon begin marching\\nin place at the correct distance.\\n8-16. While Marking Time in formation, the Soldiers adjust position to ensure proper alignment and cover.\\nThe proper distance between Soldiers while marching is one-arm\u2019s length plus 6 inches (approximately\\n36 inches). If necessary, the squad leaders take the appropriate number of steps to close any gaps should the\\ntrail of the leading platoon be uneven. The rest of the formation adjusts as necessary.\\n8-17. After sensing that the members of the platoon have obtained proper alignment and cover, the platoon\\nsergeant commands Platoon, HALT. After commanding the platoon to Halt, the platoon sergeant faces to\\nthe left as in marching and marches, inclining as necessary, to the trail of the company.\\n8-18. The remaining platoons execute in the same manner as the succeeding platoon in order from front to\\nrear. The platoon sergeants wait until the platoon sergeant to their front gives the command Mark Time,\\nMARCH, before giving the command Forward, MARCH.\\n8-19. The platoon sergeants form at the trail of the company one step to the rear and evenly spaced. The\\nplatoon sergeants are now part of the formation. If the first sergeant wants exact cover and alignment, they\\ncommand COVER. The first sergeant remains at their post and marches the company.\\nCORRECTING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN PLATOONS\\n8-20. The correct distance between platoons is five steps. To obtain correct distance (five steps) when the\\ncompany is marching in column or is in column at the Halt, the first sergeant directs CORRECT ON\\nLEADING PLATOON.\\n8-21. When at the Halt, on the directive CORRECT ON LEADING PLATOON, the platoon sergeant of\\nthe leading platoon commands (over the right shoulder) STAND FAST. The succeeding platoon sergeants\\ncommand (over the right shoulder) Forward, MARCH and then command Mark Time, MARCH and\\nPlatoon, HALT when correct distance is obtained.\\n8-22. While marching, on the directive CORRECT ON LEADING PLATOON, the platoon sergeant of\\nthe leading platoon commands (over the right shoulder) Half Step, MARCH. The succeeding platoon\\nsergeants command (over the right shoulder) CONTINUE TO MARCH, and then command Half Step,\\nMARCH as soon as the correct distance is obtained.\\n8-23. The first sergeant commands Forward, MARCH; (HALT) as soon as all platoons have obtained the\\ncorrect distance and are marching at the Half Step.\\n8-12 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Company Drill\\nFORMING A COLUMN OF TWOS AND RE-FORMING\\n8-24. The company forms a column of twos basically the same as the platoon. The first sergeant must allow\\nsufficient time for the platoon sergeants, and the squad leaders of the lead platoon, to give their supplementary\\ncommands before giving the command of execution.\\n8-25. The command for this movement is Column of twos from the right (left), MARCH. The leading\\nplatoon sergeant repeats the preparatory command. Other platoon sergeants give the supplementary\\ncommand Stand Fast. On the first sergeant\u2019s command of execution MARCH, the leading platoon executes\\nthe movement as in platoon drill. Other platoons execute the movement on their platoon sergeant\u2019s command.\\nSucceeding platoon sergeants give their commands to follow with the prescribed five-step distance between\\nplatoons.\\n8-26. Re-forming into a column of fours is executed only at the Halt. The command for this movement is\\nColumn of fours to the left (right), MARCH. On the first sergeant\u2019s command of execution, all platoons\\nexecute the movement simultaneously as described in platoon drill. As soon as the platoons are re-formed,\\nthe platoon sergeants automatically march the platoons forward and obtain the five-step distance between\\nplatoons.\\nFORMING A COMPANY MASS\\n8-27. The company may form in mass from a company in column (platoons in column) when halted or while\\nmarching. The company must be at Close Interval (Close Interval, MARCH) before the command Company\\nMass Left, MARCH is given.\\n8-28. On the preparatory command Company Mass Left, given at the Halt, the leading platoon sergeant\\ncommands Stand Fast. The platoon sergeants of the succeeding platoons command Column Half Left. On\\nthe command of execution MARCH, the leading platoon stands fast. The other platoons execute the Column\\nHalf Left and then execute a Column Half Right on the command of the platoon sergeants to a point (line)\\nthat ensures the platoons will be at Close Interval alongside the platoon to their right when halted. As the\\nplatoons come abreast of the base platoon, the platoon sergeants command Mark Time, MARCH. While the\\nplatoon is marking time, the members adjust their positions to ensure alignment on the Soldier to their right.\\nThe platoon sergeants allow their platoons to Mark Time for about eight counts and then command Platoon,\\nHALT.\\n8-29. On the preparatory command Company Mass Left while marching, given as the left foot strikes the\\nmarching surface, the leading platoon sergeant gives the supplementary command Mark Time. The\\nsucceeding platoon sergeants command Column Half Left. On the command of execution MARCH, the\\nleading platoon begins to march in place. After marking time for about eight counts, the lead platoon sergeant\\ncommands Platoon, HALT. The other platoons form in the same manner as from the Halt.\\nNotes. 1. If the commander is in charge of the formation, on the command of execution MARCH,\\nthe first sergeant and guidon bearer halt and immediately face to the right (left) in marching and\\nreposition themselves centered on the company.\\n2.If the platoon sergeants are marching at their posts on the left flank of their platoons, they must\\nwait until the platoon sergeants to their front have commanded HALT and have moved to the\\nfront of the company before moving into position.\\nALIGNING A COMPANY IN MASS\\n8-30. To align a company in mass, use the following procedures:\\n\\uf06c As soon as the company has formed in mass, the first sergeant gives the command Order, ARMS\\n(if appropriate) and then commands At Close Interval, Dress Right, DRESS.\\n\\uf06c On the command of execution DRESS, the platoon sergeant of the right platoon marches by the\\nmost direct route to the right flank and verifies the alignment of as many ranks as necessary to\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 8-13Chapter 8\\nensure proper alignment in the same manner as aligning the platoon. When they have finished the\\nverification, the platoon sergeant returns to a position one step in front of and centered on the third\\nsquad, halts, and faces to the right. When the platoon sergeant has returned to their position, the\\nfirst sergeant commands Ready, FRONT. Platoon sergeants align themselves to the right. The\\nfirst sergeant directs the platoon sergeants to move left or right to ensure the platoon sergeants are\\nevenly spaced across the front.\\nCHANGING THE DIRECTION OF MARCH OF A MASS FORMATION\\n8-31. The company changes the direction of march in mass basically the same as a platoon column\\nmovement. This movement is normally executed with the commander at their post. For clarity purposes, the\\nterm \u201ccommander\u201d is used:\\n\\uf06c When executed from the Halt, the commander has the unit execute Right Shoulder Arms (if\\nappropriate), then faces in the desired direction of march, turns their head toward the formation,\\nand commands Right (Left) Turn, MARCH:\\n\\uf0a7 On the command of execution MARCH, the platoon leaders face to the half right (left) in\\nmarching and continue to march in an arc until parallel to the new direction of march. Then\\nthey begin marching with the Half Step, dressing on the right (left) flank platoon leader until\\nthe command Forward, MARCH is given.\\n\\uf0a7 The right (left) guide (the base squad leader in the direction of turn) faces to the right (left) in\\nmarching, takes one 30-inch step in the indicated direction, and then takes up the Half Step.\\nAll other squad leaders (front rank) face to the half right (left) in marching and continue to\\nmarch in an arc until they come on line with the guide.\\n\\uf0a7 At this time, they begin marching with the Half Step and dress (glancing out of the corner of\\nthe eye) in the direction of the turn until the command Forward, MARCH is given. On that\\ncommand, the dress is automatically to the right. All other members march forward and\\nexecute the movement in the same manner as their squad leaders.\\n\\uf06c When executed while marching, the movement is the same as from the Halt except that the\\ncompany commander faces about (marching backward) to give the command Right (Left) Turn,\\nMARCH. The commander then faces about and completes the turning movement themselves.\\nAfter the company has completed the turn, they face about, commands Forward, MARCH, and\\nagain faces about.\\nFORMING A COLUMN FROM A COMPANY MASS\\n8-32. This movement is normally executed with the commander at their post. For clarity purposes, the term\\n\u201ccommander\u201d is used. To form a company in column from a company mass at the Halt, the command is\\nColumn of Platoons, Right Platoon, Column Right (Column Half Right), MARCH. The right platoon\\nleader gives the supplementary command of Forward (Column Right or Column Half Right), and the other\\nplatoon leaders command Stand Fast:\\n\\uf06c On the command of execution MARCH, the right platoon marches in the direction indicated. All\\nother platoons follow (in sequence) in column, executing Column Half Right and Column Half\\nLeft on the commands of the platoon leaders.\\n\\uf06c To execute the movement when marching, the company commander commands Port, ARMS\\n(unless at Sling Arms), and then commands Column of Platoons, Right Platoon, Double Time,\\nMARCH. On the preparatory command, the right platoon leader gives the supplementary\\ncommand Double Time, and the other platoon leader gives the supplementary command Continue\\nto March. On the command of execution MARCH, the right platoon marches in double-time.\\nOther platoon leaders (in sequence) command Column Half Right, Double Time, MARCH and\\nColumn Half Left, MARCH to bring the succeeding platoons in column with the leading platoon.\\n\\uf06c The platoon leader and the platoon sergeant reposition themselves after the supplementary\\ncommand but before the command of execution.\\n8-14 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Company Drill\\nFORMING A COMPANY IN COLUMN WITH PLATOONS IN LINE\\nAND RE-FORMING\\n8-33. This movement is normally executed with the commander at their post. For clarity purposes, the term\\n\u201ccommander\u201d is used. To form a company in column with platoons in line from a column formation at the\\nHalt, the command is Column of platoons in line, MARCH. The platoon leader of the leading platoon gives\\nthe supplementary command Stand Fast. The second platoon leader gives the supplementary command\\nColumn Right. All other platoon leaders give the supplementary command Forward:\\n\\uf06c On the command of execution MARCH, the leading platoon Stands Fast, and the second platoon\\nexecutes a Column Right, marches 12 steps past the right file of the first platoon, and executes a\\nColumn Left. As they come on line with the base platoon, the platoon leader commands Mark\\nTime, MARCH. After the platoon has marched in place for eight counts, the platoon leader\\ncommands Platoon, HALT. The succeeding platoons execute a Column Right at approximately\\nthe same location as the platoon to their front and execute a Column Left and then halt in the same\\nmanner as the second platoon. When the platoons have halted in position, the company\\ncommander commands Left, FACE. On that command, the platoon leaders and platoon sergeants\\nface in marching and assume their posts.\\n\\uf06c When executed while marching, the movements are basically the same as from the Halt except\\nthat the commander gives the command of execution as the right foot strikes the marching surface.\\nThe leading platoon leader commands Mark Time. On the preparatory command, the second\\nplatoon leader commands Column Right, and the succeeding platoon leaders command Continue\\nto March. On the command of execution MARCH, the leading platoon executes Mark Time and\\nmarches in place (approximately eight counts) until the platoon leader commands Platoon,\\nHALT. The other platoons execute the movement in the same manner as from the Halt.\\n\\uf06c To re-form in column with platoons in column, the company commander commands Right, Face;\\nColumn of Platoons, Left Platoon, MARCH. On the command Right, Face, the platoon leaders\\nand platoon sergeants face in marching and resume their posts in column. On the preparatory\\ncommand Column of Platoons, Left Platoon, the left platoon leader commands Forward,\\n(Column Left [Half Left]). All other platoon leaders command Column Half Left. On the\\ncommand of execution MARCH, the left platoon executes the movement. The other platoon\\nleaders give the appropriate commands to follow the lead platoon at the correct distance.\\nNote. If necessary, the platoons following the second platoon automatically adjust the length of\\ntheir step to ensure correct distance from the platoon to their front.\\nDISMISSING THE COMPANY\\n8-34. The company is dismissed while at Attention. It is usually dismissed by the first sergeant:\\n\\uf06c The first sergeant commands TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR PLATOONS. The platoon sergeants\\nSalute. The first sergeant returns all Salutes with one Salute. After Salutes are exchanged, the first\\nsergeant and guidon bearer leave the formation. The platoon sergeants then dismiss their platoons\\nas in platoon drill.\\n\\uf06c When the company is dismissed by the company commander, they command TAKE CHARGE\\nOF YOUR PLATOONS. The platoon leaders salute. The company commander returns all\\nSalutes with one Salute. After the Salutes are exchanged, the company commander, guidon bearer,\\nfirst sergeant, and executive officer leave the formation:\\n\\uf0a7 The platoon leader(s) faces about and commands PLATOON SERGEANT. The platoon\\nsergeant faces to the right in marching and marches (inclines) around the squad leader(s),\\nhalts three steps in front of and centered on the platoon leader and faces to the right. Each\\nplatoon leader then directs TAKE CHARGE OF THE PLATOON. Salutes are exchanged.\\nThe platoon leaders leave the formation.\\n\\uf0a7 The platoon sergeants step forward three steps, face about, and dismiss the platoons as in the\\nplatoon drill.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 8-15Chapter 8\\nSECTION III \u2013 INSPECTIONS\\n8-35. This section discusses the procedures used to conduct inspections for a company drill. The two typical\\ninspections discussed are in-ranks inspections and in-quarters inspections.\\nBASIC INFORMATION\\n8-36. The following basic information applies to conducting inspections for a company drill:\\n\\uf06c The company has one prescribed formation for inspecting personnel and equipment in ranks\u2014\\ncompany in line with platoons in line. When inspecting crew-served weapons and vehicles, the\\npersonnel are normally positioned to the rear of the formation with the operator (gunner) standing\\nby their vehicle (weapon).\\nNote. If the commander is not scheduled to receive or inspect the company, the first sergeant and\\nplatoon sergeants remain at their posts and execute company drill from their posts. For continuity\\npurposes, the term \u201cfirst sergeant\u201d may also be used to denote the commander, just as \u201cplatoon\\nsergeant\u201d may be used to denote the platoon leader when they are executing drill from their posts.\\nIf the commander is inspecting, they and the platoon leaders execute the same as described below.\\n\\uf06c The first sergeant may conduct an in-quarters (barracks) inspection to include personal\\nappearance, individual weapons, field equipment, displays, maintenance, and sanitary conditions.\\n\\uf06c When field equipment is to be inspected, it should be arranged neatly and as directed by the leader\\nin charge of the inspection. Lay equipment out in a uniformed manner with all members\u2019\\nequipment arranged the same.\\nIN-RANKS INSPECTION (LINE FORMATIONS)\\n8-37. Use the following procedures to conduct an in-ranks inspection (line formation):\\n\\uf06c With the company in a line formation, the first sergeant directs PREPARE FOR INSPECTION.\\nOn that directive, the platoon sergeants face about, open ranks, and align the company as in\\nparagraphs 8-9 and 8-10. When all platoon sergeants are facing the front, the first sergeant\\ncommands AT EASE.\\nNote. During the inspection, the guidon bearer, officers, and NCOs not in ranks assume the\\nposition of attention as the inspecting officer approaches their positions and resume the at ease\\nposition after they have been inspected (they do not execute Inspection Arms). The company\\ncommander may direct the first sergeant and executive officer to accompany them during the\\ninspection. When so directed, the executive officer and first sergeant take a position at normal\\ninterval (close interval if the company is at close interval) to the left of the company commander.\\n\\uf06c The first sergeant begins the inspection by stepping forward and inspecting the guidon bearer. The\\nfirst sergeant then faces to the half left in marching and proceeds to the right of the line. As they\\napproach the right flank platoon, the platoon sergeant commands (over their right shoulder)\\nPlatoon, ATTENTION. When the first sergeant has halted directly in front of them, they report,\\n\u201cFirst Sergeant, the platoon is prepared for inspection.\u201d (If the commander is inspecting, Salutes\\nare exchanged.) The first sergeant inspects the platoon sergeant. The first sergeant then directs the\\nplatoon sergeant to lead through the inspection, faces to the half left in marching, and halts directly\\nin front of the squad leader of the first squad. As the first sergeant faces to the half left in marching,\\nthe platoon sergeant faces to the right in marching, inclines, and halts directly in front of the second\\nSoldier in the first squad and on line with and at Normal Interval (Close Interval) to the right of\\nthe first sergeant. The other platoon sergeants execute the same actions as the first sergeant\\napproaches their platoons.\\n8-16 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Company Drill\\nNote. As soon as the platoon sergeant and first sergeant have halted in front of the first two\\nSoldiers, the platoon sergeant commands Second, Third, and Fourth Squads, AT EASE. When\\nmoving from Soldier to Soldier during the inspection, the first sergeant and platoon sergeant\\n(executive officer and first sergeant if the commander is inspecting) simultaneously face to the\\nright in marching, take two short steps (one step if the company is at close interval), halt, and face\\nto the left. After the first sergeant has inspected the last Soldier in the front rank, the platoon\\nsergeant hesitates momentarily and allows the first sergeant to precede them as the first sergeant\\ninspects the front rank from the rear. As the first sergeant begins to inspect the rear of each rank,\\nthe platoon sergeant commands the next squad to Attention. As they begin to inspect the next rank,\\nthe platoon sergeant commands the last rank inspected to stand At Ease. Normally, when\\ninspecting the rear of each rank, the first sergeant conducts a walking inspection. As the first\\nsergeant inspects the rear of the last Soldier in each rank, they turn and halt directly in front of the\\nsquad leader of the next rank. The platoon sergeant turns and halts directly in front of the second\\nSoldier. If the commander is inspecting, the executive officer and first sergeant march past\\n(behind) the company commander and assume their positions to the commander\u2019s left.\\n\\uf06c As the first sergeant halts and is directly in front of and facing the individual being inspected, the\\nindividual executes Inspection Arms. If the first sergeant wants to inspect the individual\u2019s weapon,\\nthey inspect the weapon first, then the individual\u2019s uniform and appearance. As soon as the first\\nsergeant grasps the weapon, the individual releases the weapon and resumes the Position of\\nAttention. When the first sergeant has finished inspecting the weapon, they return it in the same\\nmanner as it was received. The individual receives the weapon by grasping the center of the\\nhandguard just forward of the slip ring with the left hand and the small of the stock with the right\\nhand. They then execute Ready, Port Arms; Order Arms.\\nNote. In the event the first sergeant does not want to inspect the weapon, the individual remains\\nat Inspection Arms until the first sergeant has halted in front of and is facing the next Soldier. The\\nindividual then executes Ready, Port Arms, and Order Arms. As the first sergeant moves to the\\nrear of the rank being inspected, each Soldier, as the first sergeant approaches, unfastens the snap\\nof their scabbard, grasps the point of the scabbard with the left hand, and moves the point slightly\\nforward. The scabbard is held in position until the bayonet has been replaced or, if the bayonet is\\nnot inspected, until the first sergeant has moved to the next Soldier. At that time, the securing\\nstraps are fastened and the Position of Attention is resumed.\\n\\uf06c The correct method of manipulating a rifle for inspection is as follows:\\n\\uf0a7 When receiving the rifle from the inspected individual, reach forward and grasp the rifle at\\nthe upper portion of the handguard with the right hand. Lower the rifle diagonally to the left,\\ntwist the rifle slightly, insert the tip of the little finger of the left hand into the ejection port\\n(do not twist the rifle but insert the thumb into the receiver of the M14-series rifle), and look\\ninto the barrel. The finger reflects sufficient light for the inspection of the barrel.\\n\\uf0a7 Grasp the small of the stock with the left hand and raise the rifle to a horizontal position\\n(sights up) with the muzzle to the right. The rifle is centered on the body with the forearms\\nhorizontal and the palms up. Move the rifle horizontally to the left and inspect the upper\\nportion of the rifle beginning with the flash suppressor. Move the rifle slowly to the right\\ninspecting the butt. Return the rifle to the center of the body.\\n\\uf0a7 Keeping the rifle horizontal, rotate it 180 degrees (sights toward the body) so that the sights\\npoint toward the marching surface. Move the rifle horizontally to the left and inspect the\\nmuzzle. Move the rifle slowly to the right and inspect the butt. When moving the rifle across\\nthe body, twist the rifle as necessary and inspect the movable parts on the sides of the receiver.\\nHaving completed the inspection of the lower parts of the rifle, return it to the center of the\\nbody.\\n\\uf0a7 Keeping the rifle horizontal, rotate the rifle 180 degrees (sights away from the body) so that\\nthe sights are up. Release the left hand and return the rifle in the same manner as received.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 8-17Chapter 8\\n\\uf0a7 When inspecting a weapon other than a rifle, the inspector receives the weapon with their\\nright hand and inspects it in the most convenient manner. Having completed the inspection,\\nthe weapon is returned with the right hand in the same manner as received.\\n\\uf06c When the first sergeant has completed the inspection of the platoon, the platoon sergeant\\ncommands the platoon to Attention and overtakes the first sergeant en route back to the front of\\nthe platoon. The platoon sergeant halts at their post facing to the front (Salutes are exchanged if\\nthe commander is inspecting). The first sergeant (or commander with or without the inspecting\\nparty) faces to the right in marching and moves to the next platoon. As soon as the first sergeant\\nhas cleared the first platoon, the platoon sergeant faces about, commands Close Ranks, MARCH\\nand AT EASE, and then faces about and executes At Ease. When the first sergeant has completed\\nthe inspection of the last platoon (exchanged Salutes with the platoon sergeant), they return to\\ntheir post at the center of the company and commands the company to Attention. They then dismiss\\nthe company, as previously described in paragraph 8-32.\\n\\uf06c When the company is inspected by an officer of a higher command, on the approach of the\\ninspecting officer, the company commander commands Company, ATTENTION. They then face\\nabout, salute, and report, \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, the company is prepared for inspection.\u201d The inspection\\nis conducted as previously described in paragraph 8-37, except that the company commander takes\\na position immediately to the left of the inspecting officer. The inspection is terminated by the\\ncompany commander in the same manner prescribed for a platoon sergeant.\\nIN-QUARTERS INSPECTION (STAND BY)\\n8-38. When the first sergeant wants to conduct an in-quarters inspection, the members are positioned on line\\nwith their equipment (or as near it as possible) :\\n\\uf06c The platoon sergeant positions themselves in the path of the inspecting officer at a point near their\\narea of responsibility. At the approach of the inspecting officer, the platoon sergeant commands\\nPlatoon, ATTENTION, salutes, and reports, \u201cSir, the platoon is prepared for inspection.\u201d\\nNote. When the situation dictates, the platoon sergeant may report to the inspecting officer outside\\nof the quarters. A designated individual commands the members to Attention as the inspector\\nenters the quarters (bay).\\n\\uf06c The platoon sergeant then guides the inspector along a route dictated by the physical arrangement\\nof the personnel and equipment. Upon entering the area, the highest ranking Soldier present\\ncommands AT EASE. As the inspector approaches each individual or their equipment, the\\nindividual automatically assumes the Position of Attention. When the inspector has moved to the\\nnext Soldier, the last Soldier inspected resumes the position of At Ease. As the inspector begins to\\nexit the area after completing the inspection, CARRY ON is commanded.\\nNote. When inspecting Soldiers\u2019 rooms, Attention is not commanded. The individuals\\nautomatically assume the Position of Attention as the inspector enters the room. The inspector then\\ncommands AT EASE. As the inspector approaches each Soldier, the Soldier assumes the Position\\nof Attention and resumes At Ease after they have been inspected.\\n8-18 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Chapter 9\\nBattalion and Brigade Drill\\n\u201cThe exterior splendor, the regularity of movements, the adroitness and at the same\\ntime firmness of the mass\u2014all this gives the individual Soldier the safe and calming\\nconviction that nothing can withstand his particular regiment or battalion.\u201d\\nColmar von der Goltz, 1843-1916 Rossback und Jena\\nFor the most part, battalion and brigade drill merely provides the procedures for\\nexecuting company or battalion drill in conjunction with other companies or battalions\\nin the same formation.\\nFor drill purposes, a battalion or brigade consists of a headquarters (staff), Colors, and\\ntwo or more companies or battalions. The right flank unit serves as base when in a line\\nformation; the leading element is the base when in column.\\nNote. Executive officers, first sergeants, and platoon sergeants form the same as in-company drill\\nfor all formations, unless otherwise specified.\\nSECTION I \u2013 BATTALION FORMATIONS\\n9-1. The battalion has two basic formations\u2014a line and a column. Separate elements may be arranged in\\nseveral variations within either formation: the battalion may be formed in line with the companies in line\\nwith platoons in line, or battalion in line with companies in column with platoons in line (see figure 9-1 on\\npage 9-2). From those formations, the battalion may be positioned in a battalion in column with companies\\nin column, or companies in mass, or companies in column with platoons in line (see figure 9-2 on page 9-3).\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 9-1Chapter 9\\nFigure 9-1.

Battalion in column with companies in column or mass\\n\\uf06c Forming the battalion. To facilitate the forming of a larger unit, the commander normally alerts\\nthe component units as to the desired formation, time, place, route, uniform, and the sequence in\\nwhich the units will form. Unless the right guide\u2019s position at the formation site has been\\npreviously marked, the guides report to the site and receive instructions before the arrival of the\\ntroops:\\n\\uf0a7 The commissioned staff forms in one rank, at normal interval and centered on the commander.\\nStaff members are normally arranged in their numerical order from right to left. When enlisted\\nstaff personnel form as part of the officer staff, they form two steps to the rear of their\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 9-3Chapter 9\\nrespective staff officer. The command sergeant major (CSM) forms one step to the rear and\\nis centered on the Colors.\\n\\uf0a7 When the battalion participates as a separate element of a larger formation, or when space is\\nlimited, it is normally formed in a mass formation in the same manner as forming a company\\nmass (see figure 9-3).\\nFigure 9-3. Battalion in mass formation\\n\\uf0a7 The adjutant is responsible for the formation of troops. They take a position at the right flank\\nof the line on which the units are to form and faces down the line. The adjutant remains facing\\ndown the line until all units are formed and then marches to their post midway between the\\nline of troops and the proposed position of the commander. As the commander and their staff\\n9-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Battalion and Brigade Drill\\napproach, the adjutant commands (directs) the units to ATTENTION, faces the commander,\\nsalutes, and reports, \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, the battalion is formed.\u201d\\nNote. If guides are used, the adjutant takes their post as soon as the guides have been aligned.\\n\\uf0a7 The commander returns the Salute and commands POST. The adjutant marches forward,\\npasses to the commander\u2019s right, and takes their post as the right flank staff officer. The\\ncommander then commands or directs such actions as they desire.\\n\\uf0a7 Normally, the Colors are positioned at the center of the battalion when formed in line or\\ncolumn, and four steps to the rear of the staff when formed in mass.\\n\\uf06c Dismissing the battalion. To dismiss the battalion, the commander commands TAKE CHARGE\\nOF YOUR UNITS. The company commanders and battalion commander exchange Salutes. The\\nbattalion commander returns all Salutes with one Salute. They then dismiss their staff.\\nNote. In a battalion mass formation, the platoon leaders form as the first rank of troops. The right\\nflank platoon leader serves as the guide.\\n\\uf06c Inspecting the battalion. When the battalion is to be inspected, the adjutant forms the battalion in\\nline with companies in line and platoons in line:\\n\\uf0a7 The adjutant forms the troops, reports, and takes their position with the staff (as previously\\ndescribed in paragraph 9-1). When the adjutant has joined the staff, the battalion commander\\ndirects PREPARE FOR INSPECTION. Unit commanders face about and give the same\\ndirective. The platoon leaders prepare their platoons for inspection in the same manner as in\\ncompany drill. When all of the platoons in each company have completed opening ranks and\\nhave dressed right, the company commander faces the battalion commander. When all\\ncompany commanders are again facing them, the battalion commander commands AT EASE.\\nNote. Because of the time involved in inspecting a battalion, the commander normally directs their\\nstaff to inspect the companies while they inspect the Colors and make a general inspection of the\\nbattalion. The Color guards do not execute Inspection Arms.\\n\\uf0a7 As the battalion commander (or their designated staff officer) approaches the company, the\\ncompany commander faces about, salutes, and reports, \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, ______ Company is\\nprepared for inspection.\u201d The inspecting officer then proceeds to the first platoon to be\\ninspected. The company commander takes a position to the left of the inspecting officer. The\\nplatoons are inspected in the same manner as explained in company drill. In the event a\\nplatoon has already been inspected by a staff officer or is waiting to be inspected by a staff\\nofficer and the battalion commander approaches, the battalion commander is invited to inspect\\nthe platoon.\\n\\uf0a7 When the inspection has been completed and the battalion commander is en route back to\\ntheir post, the company commanders bring their units to ATTENTION, CLOSE RANKS,\\nand AT EASE. When the battalion commander has returned to the front of the formation and\\nall staff officers have completed their inspection, the battalion commander commands\\nBattalion, ATTENTION and dismisses the battalion (as previously described).\\n\\uf0a7 If the battalion is being inspected by a higher commander and their staff, the battalion\\ncommander reports to the inspecting officer in the same manner as the company commanders.\\nThe battalion commander\u2019s staff takes a position to the left of the higher inspecting staff and\\nescorts them to the unit. The battalion commander escorts the higher commander.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 9-5Chapter 9\\nSECTION II \u2013 BRIGADE FORMATIONS\\n9-2. The brigade, like the battalion, has two basic formations\u2014a line and a column.

It is the noblest and proudest form\\nof drill. Based on the \u2018blunt whetstone\u2019 of drill instruction to recruits it was for many\\nhundreds of years the foundation of battle discipline in all Armies\u2026\u201d\\n\u201cToday, once the elements of discipline have been instilled through drill on the parade\\nsquare, it develops, naturally, into various forms of crew drill, gun drill, and battle drill\\nbut the aim of discipline remains unchanged. This aim is the conquest of fear. Drill\\nhelps to achieve this because when it is carried out Soldiers tend to lose their\\nindividuality and are unified into a group under obedience to orders.\u201d\\n\u201cIf Soldiers are to give their best in war they must be united. Discipline seeks through\\ndrill to instill into all ranks this sense of unity, by requiring them to obey orders as one.\\nA Ceremonial parade, moreover, provides an occasion for Soldiers to express pride in\\ntheir performance, pride in the Regiment or Corps and pride in the profession of Arms.\u201d\\nGeneral Sir Harold Alexander, Ceremonial for the\\nArmy Ministry for Defense, Army Department\\nNovember 1968\\nNote. See appendix G for a checklist for conducting a successful ceremony.\\nChapter 10\\nReviews\\nThis chapter discusses the general history of the review and the different types of\\nreviews used in the Army today.\\nSECTION I \u2013 HISTORY\\n10-1. Reviews can be traced to the Middle Ages when rulers, as a way of showing their strength, were likely\\nto have military ceremonies. Military ceremonies and reviews are a popular tradition which carries on today\\nin military forces around the world.\\n10-2. In the American Army, reviews were originally outlined in Baron Friedrich von Steuben\u2019s Blue Book\\nand practiced by revolutionary Soldiers. A review consisted of four stages: a formation of troops, presentation\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 10-1Chapter 10\\nand honors, inspection, and a march in review. Today\u2019s reviews have incorporated three additional stages:\\nhonors to the Nation, remarks, and a conclusion. The presence of the band represents the significant role that\\nthe drum, fife, and other musical instruments have played throughout military history for signaling in camp\\nor on the battlefield. The presence of the Colors at the center of the formation represents their presence at the\\nforefront of the unit during the heat of battle.\\n10-3. At the beginning of the 17th century, armies throughout the world were adopting the regimental system.\\nRegiments were assigned a specific Color or number for ease of identification and position on the battlefield.\\nIn battle, the Color (or flag) party marched at the front and center of its unit as a point for the unit to dress\\non. By leading the unit in battle, the Colors became prime targets, as victories in those days were expressed\\nin terms of the number of enemy Colors captured; consequently, the Color party bore the brunt of the battle\\nand suffered heavy casualties. Historically, in the American Army, the Colors have been placed in the center\\nof the formation and have been considered part of the company on the immediate right of the Colors. This\\ncompany is still called the Color unit:\\n\\uf06c In Infantry regulations of 1812, the lineup of companies from right to left was determined by the\\nseniority of the company commander, with the senior on the right. The manual for U.S. Infantry\\ntactics in 1862 placed the senior commander on the right and the second senior on the left with the\\nother eight companies in between. After they were lined up, the companies were then numbered\\nfirst through tenth from right to left. In the Infantry drill regulations of 1892, companies continued\\nto be aligned by seniority. Between 1910 and 1970, companies were designated by letters of the\\nalphabet and lined up from right to left: headquarters company, rifle companies in alphabetical\\norder, and then any combat support companies. The Colors, however, remained posted in the\\ncenter of the formation.\\n\\uf06c Musical elements (usually drums and fifes, and sometimes a band) were used during actual battle\\nand marched 12 to 15 paces to the rear of the formation. By 1892, the Infantry drill regulations\\nposted bands and field music on the right of the formation or at the head of the formation when it\\nmoved in column.\\n10-4. Honors appears to have originated as musical fanfare and later a gun salute was added. The\\ncombination of the two now constitute military honors:\\n\\uf06c The custom of announcing the arrival of royalty and heads of state with a fanfare of trumpets or\\ndrum rolls had its origin in England. It is ironic that drum Ruffles and the two-note bugle call\\nFlourishes, used in this manner today, have all but disappeared in the British Commonwealth\\nwhile the tradition is still carried on in the United States.\\n\\uf06c The colonists brought many of the military customs of their mother country with them when they\\ncame to America. At the time of the French-Indian Wars, Soldiers were instructed to \u201crest (present\\narms) and beat two ruffles\u201d for the Royal Governor of Virginia. In 1776, officers of the\\nContinental Army were advised that \u201cthe adjutant is to order a drum and fife to give two ruffles\\nto a major general and one to a brigadier.\u201d\\n\\uf06c When Baron von Steuben wrote his manual of discipline, he stated that there were to be \u201ccertain\\nruffles\u201d for generals. It is interesting to note that General George Washington was not accorded\\nruffles. Instead, his arrival was announced by a march\u2014more than likely \u201cWashington\u2019s\\nMarch\u201d\u2014that is still played today. In time, this custom was extended to include governors of\\nsovereign states and visiting foreign dignitaries.\\n\\uf06c Ruffles were not considered elegant and were used exclusively by the military. In some cases they\\nwere even accorded to the officer of the day.\\n\\uf06c It was some time before trumpets were added to the drum rolls; it is believed they were also used\\nduring the War of 1812. Honors for dignitaries were modified to include a flourish of trumpets\\ncalled the \u201cThree Cheers.\u201d It is likely that this particular salute evolved into the \u201cRuffles and\\nFlourishes\u201d as they are played today.\\n\\uf06c Navy records indicate that the regulations of 1876 stipulated there would be a ruffle of drums to\\nannounce the President\u2019s arrival but made no mention of the trumpet flourishes. A later regulation\\n(1893) stated that the chief executive would receive four \u201cRuffles and Flourishes.\u201d\\n\\uf06c Gun salutes may be traced back to a period when it took a long time to reload guns. By firing all\\nits guns at once, the battery or fort was left defenseless. The number of guns fired as a salute to\\n10-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Reviews\\nhonor a U.S. President was not established until 1841. Before that, presidential honors included\\none gun for every state. It reached at least 24 guns before it was decided that any more guns would\\nbe unrealistic and the number of 21 was adopted in 1841. In 1875, the United States adopted\\n21 guns for the international salute and that number is currently used as honors for all dignitaries\\nof rank equivalent to the President.\\nSECTION II \u2013 TYPES OF REVIEWS\\n10-5. A review is a military ceremony used to\u2014\\n\\uf06c Honor a visiting, high-ranking commander, official, or dignitary, and/or permit them to observe\\nthe state of training of a command.\\n\\uf06c Present decorations and awards.\\n\\uf06c Honor or recognize unit or individual achievements.\\n\\uf06c Commemorate events.\\n10-6. Normally, a review is conducted with a battalion or larger troop unit; however, a composite or\\nrepresentative element consisting of two or more platoons may serve the same purpose. A review consists of\\nthe following steps in sequence:\\n\\uf06c Formation of troops.\\n\\uf06c Presentation of command and honors (although primarily a characteristic of a parade, \u201csound off\u201d\\nmay be included here to enhance the ceremony).\\n\\uf06c Inspection. (The inspection stage may be omitted for decorations, awards, or individual\\nrecognition ceremonies.)\\n\\uf06c Honors to the Nation.\\n\\uf06c Remarks.\\n\\uf06c March in review.\\n\\uf06c Conclusion.\\nNote. If retreat is conducted as part of the review, it occurs after presentation of the command and\\nhonors and before the inspection. Honors to the Nation is omitted.\\n10-7. Other ceremonial activities, or combinations thereof, that may be incorporated within the framework\\nof a review are reviews with\u2014\\n\\uf06c Decorations, awards, and individual retirement.\\n\\uf06c Change of command, activation, or inactivation of units.\\n\\uf06c Retreat.\\n\\uf06c Retreat and retirement, decorations, and awards.\\n\\uf06c Retreat and change of command, activation, or inactivation of units.\\nNote. Review with change of command should not be combined with an awards ceremony.\\nAwarding a decoration to an outgoing command is accomplished separately from, and preferably\\nbefore, a review at which the responsibility of command is transferred.\\n10-8. In order that a commander may review their own command or accompany a visiting reviewing officer,\\nthey normally designate an officer of their command as commanding officer of troops (known as COT). The\\nCOT is responsible for the preparation of the troops for the review.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 10-3Chapter 10\\n10-9. The ready line and final line on which the units are to form and the route of march are marked or\\ndesignated before beginning the ceremony (see figure 10-1 on page 10-4):\\n\\uf06c The primary function of the ready line is to enable the unit commander to arrange their unit into\\nthe prescribed formation before movement to the final line. The ready line is to the rear of the final\\nline. Flags or appropriate markings are used to designate the post of the reviewing officer and the\\npoints where Eyes, RIGHT and Ready, FRONT are to be commanded (6 steps to the reviewing\\nofficer\u2019s right and left and from 6 to 20 steps in front of the reviewing officer).\\n\\uf06c Commanders should determine the length of their formation (steps) so that they know how far\\nbeyond the ready front marker (six steps beyond the reviewing officer) they command Ready,\\nFRONT.

At the beginning of the ceremony, the outgoing commander should assume the role of host\\nor host commander. The senior official or commander designated to \u201cpass the organizational\\nColor\u201d should assume the role of an honored guest or reviewing officer except during that brief\\nportion of the ceremony wherein they may be called upon to act as a host or host commander for\\nthe purpose of passing the organizational Color. Since the inspection of troops normally occurs\\nearly in the ceremony, the incoming commander is also at that time treated as a guest and is\\nexpected to accompany the outgoing commander and senior official during the inspection. After\\nthe organizational Color has been passed, the incoming commander should assume the role of host\\nor host commander, and the senior official and outgoing commander both become honored guests\\nor reviewing officers at this point and remain as such for the balance of the ceremony (see\\nfigure 10-10).\\nFigure 10-10.

A special review is conducted by a composite or representative unit and serves the same purposes\\nas a standard review when a larger formation is not practical. The composite unit normally consists of a band,\\nColors, two or more platoons, and a salute battery (when appropriate). The reduced formation is not a reason\\nto eliminate any of the components of a review or change their sequence:\\n\\uf06c A special review is essentially the same as a battalion or larger unit review, except\u2014\\n\\uf0a7 The troops are formed on a final line.\\n\\uf0a7 Attention and Adjutant\u2019s Call are not sounded.\\n\\uf0a7 Neither the adjutant nor a staff participate.\\n\\uf0a7 Unit guidons are not used in this formation.

The band steps off playing a march on the command of\\nForward, MARCH. Platoon leaders remain six steps to the front of and centered on their\\nplatoons. Platoon sergeants remain one step to the rear of and centered on their platoon.\\n\\uf0a7 Platoon leaders command Column Left, MARCH at the first turn marker and Left Flank,\\nMARCH when centered on the reviewing line.\\n\\uf06c Indoor ceremonies retain the same sequence as a normal review, excluding elements that are\\nprecluded because of space. Generally, a pass in review cannot be conducted indoors.\\n10-26 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Chapter 11\\nParades\\nThe term \u201cparade\u201d had various meanings to Continental Army troops camped at Valley\\nForge. It could mean to form, march, and drill. Present-day parade procedures\\noriginated from the daily activities conducted then to form, organize, instruct, and issue\\nparole and countersign words to the various guards on duty (outpost, picket, camp, and\\nquarters). Early parades also enabled commanders to give special instructions to\\nsubordinate leaders and to make command announcements. In the U.S. Army\\nregulations of 1863, reviews were a type of parade, and \u201cdress parades\u201d were\\nconducted daily, except on extraordinary and urgent occasions. The parade remains\\nbasically the same as the review except that it has retained its original intent\u2014a method\\nwhereby unit commanders could inspect troops, present awards, and issue information.\\nThe sequence of a parade has the following steps\u2014formation of troops, sound off by\\na band, honors to the Nation, presentation, manual of arms, report, orders published,\\nofficers center, pass in review.\\nSECTION I \u2013 HISTORY\\n11-1. Battalion and brigade parades are opened by the adjutant\u2019s call sounded on a trumpet. This call has\\nopened parades of the American forces for over 150 years. After some preliminaries, the adjutant directs\\nSOUND OFF and the band plays three chords. Having sounded off, the band marches in front of the troops\\nand then countermarches to its original position. This March across the front of the line is said to have\\noriginated with the Crusades (A.D. 1095 to 1260). The troops offering themselves for holy service were\\ndrawn up in a long formation and the band countermarched only before those chosen to serve. In American\\nceremonies, the sound off has been handed down as a ceremonial tradition.\\n11-2. After the band sounds off, the commanding officer may, if they wish, give the troops some Facings or\\nmovements of the manual of arms. This was the traditional way in which they established control over their\\ncommand, and it has been practiced in the United States since the Revolutionary War.\\n11-3. Parades in the Revolutionary Army were usually held at \u201cTroops\u201d or about 8 AM and was the time\\nused for sergeants to call the roll and report it to the adjutant. After the sergeants had returned to their posts,\\nthe commander directed that necessary orders and information be reported. After the adjutant had read the\\norders, they announced Parade is dismissed. At that time, officers moved to a position centered on the\\ncommanding officer. As the commander gave specific instructions to the officers, the first sergeants would\\nmarch their units back to their respective company areas where they would be dismissed.\\nSECTION II \u2013 PREPARATION\\n11-4. The appearance and movement of troops in formation are the primary characteristics of a parade. The\\npreparation and organization of troops for a parade are similar to that of a review. In a parade, since the COT\\nis also the reviewing officer, the distance between the troops and the commander is greater than that for a\\nreview. Other differences are that the band conducts Sound Off, the inspection is omitted, a report is rendered,\\norders are published, and officers and guidons are marched forward and centered on the commander. If retreat\\nis scheduled, honors to the Nation are conducted concurrently with retreat.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 11-1Chapter 11\\nSECTION III \u2013 TYPES OF PARADES\\n11-5. The procedures for conducting a ceremonial battalion parade, a ceremonial brigade parade, and street\\nparades are discussed herein. The ceremonial battalion parade and ceremonial brigade parade are conducted\\nvery similar in nature, but a brigade ceremonial parade is conducted in a larger scale with a few differences.\\nCEREMONIAL BATTALION PARADE\\n11-6. The procedures for conducting a ceremonial battalion parade begin with the formation of troops. The\\nadjutant then directs Sound Off to the battalion formation followed by honors to the Nation. Immediately\\nafter honors, the adjutant announces Order Arms and presents the battalion to the battalion commander. The\\ncommander may direct manual of arms and then have the commanders report that their unit is accounted for.\\nOrders will then be published, officers will conduct a center march, and then finally the pass in review and\\nthe conclusion of the parade.\\nFORMATION OF TROOPS\\n11-7. Units are moved to their positions on the ready line in the most convenient manner. The commander\\nprescribes the routes, sequence, and time of arrival on the ready line. The commander and their staff take\\ntheir posts before adjutant\u2019s call. The procedure for moving from the ready line to the final line is the same\\nas for a review.\\nSOUND OFF\\n11-8. After the battalion has been formed, aligned, and given Parade Rest on the final line, the adjutant\\ndirects SOUND OFF and assumes the position of Parade Rest. The adjutant remains facing the formation:\\n\\uf06c At the directive Sound Off, the band plays three sound off chords. At the conclusion of the third\\nchord, the band moves forward playing a march in quick time. The band executes a left turn to\\nmarch across the front of the troops. At the left of the line of troops, the band countermarches and\\nreturns over the same ground to the right of the line. After the band has passed beyond the right\\nof the troops, it executes a right turn, countermarches again, and halts in its original position.\\n\\uf06c When the band has halted, it ceases playing at the next convenient place in the music and again\\nplays the three sound off chords. (Trooping the line by the band may be eliminated when\\nceremonies are conducted indoors during inclement weather and space is limited.)\\nNote. Retreat, when scheduled, is integrated at this point. Upon completion of the sound off\\nchords, the band pauses briefly and then plays retreat (by the trumpet section) without a command\\nfrom the adjutant. Upon completion of retreat, the adjutant comes to Attention and directs BRING\\nYOUR UNITS TO ATTENTION AND PRESENT ARMS. The commander and their staff\\nassume Parade Rest, Attention, Present Arms, and Order Arms with the adjutant. The adjutant\\nfaces about and salutes. The adjutant\u2019s Salute is the signal for the band to play \u201cTo the Color\u201d or\\nthe national anthem. At the conclusion of \u201cTo the Color\u201d or the national anthem, the adjutant\\ncomes to Order Arms, faces about, and directs BRING YOUR UNITS TO ORDER ARMS.\\nAfter the last unit comes to Order Arms, the adjutant faces about.\\nHONORS TO THE NATION\\n11-9. If retreat is not conducted, the adjutant (after the band has completed Sound Off) assumes the position\\nof Attention and directs BRING YOUR UNITS TO ATTENTION AND PRESENT ARMS. Unit\\ncommanders assume the position of Attention, face about, and command Company, ATTENTION, Present,\\nARMS. They face about and salute. When all units are at Present Arms, the adjutant faces about and salutes.\\nThis is the signal for the band to play the national anthem. The battalion commander and their staff execute\\nPresent, ARMS on their command on the first note of the music.\\n11-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Parades\\nPRESENTATION\\n11-10. Upon completion of the national anthem, the battalion commander and their staff execute Order,\\nARMS on their command. The adjutant terminates their Salute, faces about, and directs BRING YOUR\\nUNITS TO ORDER ARMS. Unit commanders terminate their Salute, face about, command Order, ARMS,\\nand then face (back) to the front. When all units are at Order Arms, the adjutant faces about, salutes, and\\nreports Sir or Ma\u2019am, the parade is formed. The battalion commander returns the Salute and commands\\nPOST. The adjutant marches forward, passes by the battalion commander\u2019s right, and takes their post as the\\nright flank member of the staff.\\nMANUAL OF ARMS\\n11-11. After the adjutant has joined the staff, the battalion commander commands such movements in the\\nmanual of arms as they may desire. When desired, the commander may direct, rather than command, HAVE\\nYOUR UNITS EXECUTE THE MANUAL OF ARMS. The unit commanders, in sequence from right to\\nleft, command Right Shoulder, ARMS; Port, ARMS; Left Shoulder, ARMS; Order, ARMS. When the unit\\non the right has completed all the movements, the next unit then begins and so on until the last unit has\\ncompleted the movements.\\nREPORT\\n11-12. When all units have completed the manual of arms, the battalion commander then directs RECEIVE\\nTHE REPORT. The adjutant returns to their position at the center of the command and commands\\nREPORT. Unit commanders in succession, from right to left, salute and report \u201c________ Company, all\\npresent or accounted for.\u201d The adjutant returns each commander\u2019s Salute. After receiving the report, the\\nadjutant faces about, salutes, and reports \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, all present or accounted for.\u201d\\nPUBLISHING OF ORDERS\\n11-13. The battalion commander returns the Salute and directs PUBLISH THE ORDERS. The adjutant\\nfaces about and directs ATTENTION TO ORDERS (they then read the orders). More information about\\nAttention to Orders can be found in appendix G.\\nOFFICERS CENTER MARCH\\n11-14. After reading the orders, the adjutant directs BRING YOUR UNITS TO PARADE REST:\\n\\uf06c Unit commanders face about and command Parade, REST. They then face about and come to\\nParade Rest. When all units are at Parade Rest, the adjutant commands (loud enough for the band\\nto hear) Officers (pause), Center (long pause), MARCH. They then face about and takes their\\npost with the staff:\\n\\uf0a7 On the command Officers, all officers come to Attention and guidon bearers come to Carry\\nGuidon.\\n\\uf0a7 On the command Center, when companies are in mass formation, the company commanders\\nand guidon bearers face to the center. Officers commanding platoons move one step forward\\nand face to the center. Executive officers move through the interval between units nearest to\\nthe center and take their posts in the column formed by the platoon leaders.\\n\\uf0a7 At the command MARCH, the band plays marching music and continues to play until the\\nofficers have halted in front of the commander. Officers and guidon bearers close to the center,\\nhalt, and individually face to the front. Company commanders, when moving to the center,\\nface half right or half left in marching, march to the front, and close on a line four steps in\\nadvance of the line of guidon bearers. The guidon bearers close on their own line, each taking\\na post to the rear of their company commander. All other officers close on the line of platoon\\nleaders (see figure 11-1 on page 11-4).\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 11-3Chapter 11\\nFigure 11-1.

They halt the leading rank in line, three steps\\nfrom the line of companies. The senior commander then commands Post (pause), MARCH:\\n\\uf0a7 At the command Post, the officers and guidon bearers face outward.\\n\\uf0a7 At the command MARCH, the officers and guidon bearers step off and return to their posts\\nand come to Parade Rest. The music ceases when the last officer has taken their post and\\ncome to Parade Rest.\\n\\uf06c During the execution of Officers Center and Officers Post, except when saluting, all guidon\\nbearers remain at Carry Guidon.\\nPASS IN REVIEW\\n11-15. When all officers have returned to their posts and the band has stopped playing, the battalion\\ncommander directs BRING YOUR UNITS TO ATTENTION. Unit commanders assume the position of\\nAttention, face about, and command Company, ATTENTION. Then they face about. When all units are at\\nAttention, the battalion commander directs PASS IN REVIEW. The battalion passes in review in the same\\nmanner as prescribed for a review except the units render honors when six steps to the left of the COT and\\nstaff, and terminate honors when the unit is six steps to the right of the COT and staff. The COT and staff\\nthen assume the role of the reviewing party at their location on the field.\\n11-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Parades\\nCONCLUSION\\n11-16. When the last element of troops has passed the reviewing stand and executed Ready Front, the band\\nceases playing and goes immediately into an eight-bar drum cadence. On the first beat following drum\\ncadence, the band begins playing (in place) the official version of \u201cThe Army Goes Rolling Along,\u201d\\nbeginning at the introduction. On the second time through letter A (or ninth bar), the drum major has the\\nband march forward and execute a left turn onto the reviewing line while continuing to play until the\\ncompletion of the chorus. The completion of \u201cThe Army Goes Rolling Along\u201d terminates the ceremony. It\\nis appropriate for spectators to rise and stand at the position of Attention while \u201cThe Army Goes Rolling\\nAlong\u201d plays.\\nCEREMONIAL BRIGADE PARADE\\n11-17. The brigade ordinarily is formed in line with battalions in mass formations. The parade is the same\\nas the ceremonial battalion parade with the following exceptions:\\n\\uf06c The brigade commander is substituted for battalion commander, and brigade for battalion, in the\\ndescription.\\n\\uf06c In moving across the front of the brigade, the band passes in front of the line of battalion\\ncommanders during the Sound Off.\\n11-18. The battalions execute Present Arms, Order Arms, Parade Rest, and come to Attention on the\\ncommand of execution of their respective commanders. Reports are made by the battalion commanders\\ninstead of company commanders.\\n11-19. At the command of execution MARCH, of Officers, Center, MARCH, the battalion commanders,\\ntheir staffs, and Colors close on the line of battalion commanders and staffs. The company commanders face\\nto the half right or half left in marching and close on a line four steps to the rear of the battalion Color. The\\nguidon bearers face half right or half left in marching and close on a line four steps back of the company\\ncommanders. The other officers face half right or half left in marching and close on a line four steps behind\\nthe guidon bearers. The CSM remains in place and assumes command of the battalion.\\n11-20. The officers, guidon bearers, and Colors having closed and faced to the front, the senior battalion\\ncommander commands Forward, MARCH. The center officer of the leading rank is the guide. On the\\ncommand of the senior battalion commander, the officers, guidon bearers, and Colors are halted with the\\nleading ranks six steps from the brigade commander. They salute the brigade commander; the brigade\\ncommander returns the Salute. The commands Present, ARMS and Order, ARMS are given by the senior\\nbattalion commander.\\n11-21. The brigade commander commands Officers, Post (pause), MARCH. On the command Post, the\\nColors execute Reverse March. All others execute About Face. On the command of execution MARCH, the\\nofficers, Colors, and guidon bearers march forward. The senior battalion commander commands Officers,\\nHALT so that the rank of battalion commanders is on line with its original position. The senior battalion\\ncommander then commands Post (pause), MARCH. On the command Post, the battalion commanders and\\nstaffs face outward, the battalion Color guard executes wheeling movements, and on the command of\\nexecution MARCH, the Color guard marches back to its original position. The company commanders,\\nguidon bearers, and other officers face to the half right or half left in marching and move back to their original\\npositions.\\nSTREET PARADES\\n11-22. For street parades, troops are formed and marched in the most convenient manner. Street parades\\nmay include military vehicles. Towed or transported weapons add to the drama of a street parade. Cargo\\nvehicles are included only to increase the size of the display.\\n\\uf06c Practical formations for street parades are\u2014\\n\\uf0a7 Columns of threes and fours.\\n\\uf0a7 Two or more columns of threes and fours abreast.\\n\\uf0a7 Mass formation.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 11-5Chapter 11\\n\\uf06c The vehicles move in a single column or column of twos, threes, or fours abreast, as the width of\\nthe street permits.\\n\\uf06c In order to keep military units in the same cadence, units should not march between two bands.\\n.\\n11-6 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Chapter 12\\nHonor Guards\\nIn the Continental Army, honor guards were used as a protective measure and as a\\nmeans of showing the improvement in discipline in the newly formed army. They were\\nprobably selected specifically for their size and strength and maybe their proven\\nprowess in combat. Today, the honor guard formation is a special courtesy to visiting\\ndignitaries. Members of the guard are selected for their Soldierly appearance and\\nsuperior discipline.\\nSECTION I \u2013 BASIC INFORMATION\\n12-1. The basic information herein applies to all honor guards:\\n\\uf06c An honor guard consists of a band, Colors, salute battery (when available and appropriate), and a\\nformation of troops. Honor guards render personal honors to persons of high military or civilian\\nrank or position upon arrival or departure from a military command. Honor guards are not a\\nsubstitute for those ceremonies appropriate in a review or parade.\\n\\uf06c An honor guard should not be so large as to compromise the exceptional standards required of\\nhonor guards. Uniforms will be those prescribed in Army regulations and tables of allowance.\\n\\uf06c The senior commander or their appointed representative is the host and takes part in the ceremony.\\nThey are briefed on the sequence of events and advises the person to be honored of actions that\\nwill take place.\\n\\uf06c Before the arrival of the person(s) to be honored, the honor guard commander positions the band,\\nformation of troops, and salute battery from right to left in that order. The troops are formed in\\nline of companies or platoons with the Colors centered. When conditions dictate, the salute battery\\nmay be located separately but its control and purpose must not be impaired.\\nSECTION II \u2013 SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AND INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS\\n12-2. The sequence of events for conducting an honor guard are discussed herein:\\n\\uf06c At the approach of the person(s) to be honored, the honor guard commander faces about,\\ncommands Honor guard, ATTENTION, and then faces about again. The host welcomes the\\nperson(s) to be honored on arrival, escorts them to the position not more than 20 steps in front of\\nand facing the honor guard commander and takes their position on the guest\u2019s left. When the\\nperson(s) to be honored has halted in their position, the honor guard commander faces about,\\ncommands Present, ARMS, faces about, and Salutes.\\n\\uf06c As the honor guard commander executes the Hand Salute, the band begins the appropriate honors.\\nWhen a salute battery is employed, the first round is fired simultaneously with the first note of the\\nmusic and remaining rounds are fired at 3-second intervals. All military personnel in the vicinity\\nof the honor guard formation, except those on security duty, salute during the firing of the cannon\\nsalute and the rendering of honors (see AR 600-25).\\nNote. If a foreign dignitary\u2019s honors include their national anthem, the sequence of the ceremony\\nis: honors, inspection, and \u201cThe Army Goes Rolling Along\u201d concluding the ceremony.\\n\\uf06c On the completion of the honors, the honor guard commander terminates their Salute, faces about,\\nand commands Order, ARMS. The honor guard commander then faces about.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 12-1Chapter 12\\n\\uf06c At this time, the honoree(s) and host march forward and halt three steps from the honor guard\\ncommander. The honor guard commander salutes and reports \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, the honor guard is\\nprepared for inspection.\u201d The band begins to play appropriate music upon the salute of the guard\\ncommander and continues to play until the members of the reviewing party have returned to their\\nposts. The guard commander then guides the honoree(s) and host to the right of the band. The\\ninspecting party passes along the front and rear of the line of troops, to include the salute battery\\n(if used), with the option of omitting the salute battery from the inspection if its distance from the\\nremainder of the honor guard is prohibitive.\\n\\uf06c The honor guard commander takes a position on the right of the person(s) honored and guides\\nthem through the inspection. The host takes a position on the right of the honor guard commander.\\n\\uf06c The inspection begins at the right of the band. The inspecting party passes along the front rank of\\ntroops. Ranks are not opened; the individual members of the honor guard do not come to\\nInspection Arms or execute Eyes Right.\\n\\uf06c The members of the inspecting party render Hand Salutes when they pass in front of the Colors.\\n\\uf06c The inspection terminates at the right flank of the band. The honor guard commander commands\\nParty, HALT. The bandmaster has the band play softly until the reviewing party members begin\\nmarching back to their posts. The honor guard commander faces to the half left in marching, takes\\ntwo steps, halts, and faces about. The host repositions themselves to the left of the honoree(s).\\nWhen the host is in position, the honor guard commander and the honoree(s) exchange Salutes.\\nUpon termination of the Salutes, the honoree(s) and the host immediately face to the half left in\\nmarching and return to their posts. The honor guard commander hesitates momentarily, then faces\\nto the right in marching, and returns to their post.\\n\\uf06c After the inspection is terminated and the honoree(s) and host return to their positions, the honor\\nguard is given Present, ARMS and the band plays the national anthem. If the honoree(s) is a\\nforeign dignitary, the national anthem of their country is played first, followed by an approximate\\n3-second drum roll and the playing of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d\\n\\uf06c When \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d ends, the command Order, ARMS is given. The honor guard\\ncommander faces about after the command for Order Arms is given and remains at Attention while\\nthe band plays one chorus of \u201cThe Army Goes Rolling Along,\u201d beginning at the introduction. At\\nthe completion of \u201cThe Army Goes Rolling Along,\u201d the honor guard commander salutes and\\nannounces \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, this concludes the ceremony.\u201d The honor guard remains at Attention\\nuntil the honoree(s) has departed. The band may play incidental background music while the\\nhonoree(s) is being introduced to the staff and other guests.\\nSECTION III \u2013 HONOR CORDON CEREMONIES\\n12-3. In addition to a scheduled honor guard ceremony, an honor cordon\u2014a line of Soldiers to honor a\\ndignitary upon entering or exiting from a given place or vehicle\u2014may be used when welcoming or\\nbidding farewell to distinguished visitors. The ceremony consists of a select group of Soldiers with\\ncharacteristics associated with honor guards, designated to honor and provide security at the immediate\\narrival or departure site:\\n\\uf06c The honor cordon normally consists of two squads, a senior sergeant, a cordon commander, and a\\nhost. When deemed appropriate, the commander may elect to use a band, Colors, and\\ndistinguishing flags:\\n\\uf0a7 Arrival. Upon arrival of the craft or vehicle, the cordon is marched to a position near the exit\\n(ramp) in two columns, centered on the exit, faced to the center, and dressed with about three\\nsteps distance between the ranks. As the honored guest(s) and greeting party depart the\\nimmediate vicinity of the exit, and approach within three steps of the host, the cordon\\ncommander commands Present, ARMS, and the entire cordon salutes simultaneously. After\\nthe honored guest(s) and all greeting party members have cleared the formation, the cordon\\ncommander commands Order, ARMS, and the cordon members come to Order Arms\\nsimultaneously (see figure 12-1 on page 12-4).\\n\\uf0a7 Departure. The formation for the honor cordon upon departure is basically the same as that\\nfor arrival, except the cordon commander and the senior sergeant position themselves on the\\n12-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Honor Guards\\nflank of the formation away from the departure site. At the approach (about three steps) of the\\nhonored guest(s) and host, the cordon commander commands Present, ARMS, and the\\ncordon salutes simultaneously. After the honored guest has entered the conveyance, the\\ncordon commander commands Order, ARMS and remains in place until the conveyance has\\ndeparted. If the conveyance is an aircraft, the cordon commander commands Order, ARMS;\\nGuards, FACE, and the guards face toward the cordon commander. The honor cordon departs\\nthe area.\\n\\uf06c When a band and Colors are a part of the arrival or departure ceremonies, they are positioned as\\nshown in figure 12-1 on page 12-4. The band plays appropriate music during the ceremony. The\\norganizational Color is dipped in salute when the honored guest(s) approaches to within six steps.\\nAfter they pass, it is returned to the carry position. As soon as the guest(s) has entered the\\nconveyance during a departure ceremony, the Colors and distinguishing flags depart the area with\\nthe honor cordon.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 12-3Chapter 12\\nFigure 12-1. Honor cordon formations\\n12-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Chapter 13\\nRetreats and Reveilles\\nRetreat is a ceremony in which the unit honors the U.S. flag when it is lowered in the\\nevening. This ceremony is conducted at the direction of the unit commanders. The\\ninstallation commander sets the time for sounding retreat. Reveille is a ceremony in\\nwhich a unit honors the U.S. flag as it is raised in the morning. This ceremony is\\nconducted at the direction of the commander. The installation commander sets the time\\nfor sounding reveille. (See appendix I for more information on raising the flag.)\\nSECTION I \u2013 RETREAT\\n13-1. The term \u201cretreat\u201d is taken from the French word \u201cretraite\u201d and refers to the evening ceremony. The\\nbugle call sounded at retreat was first used in the French army and dates to the Crusades. Retreat was sounded\\nat sunset to notify sentries to start challenging until sunrise, and to tell the rank and file to go to their quarters.\\nThe ceremony remains as a tradition. The old Cavalry call \u201cTo the Standard,\u201d in use from about 1835, has\\nbeen replaced by the present call of \u201cTo the Color.\u201d This remains as music honoring the flag as it is lowered\\nin the evening.\\nRETREAT SEQUENCE OF EVENTS\\n13-2. The sequence of events for conducting retreat are discussed herein:\\n\\uf06c The unit is formed facing the flag 5 minutes (if possible) before the sounding of retreat. Four\\nminutes before the sounding of retreat, the adjutant or other appointed officer takes their position\\ncentered on and facing the line of troops and commands Battalion, ATTENTION and then\\nParade, REST.\\n\\uf06c The adjutant faces about and executes Parade Rest. On the last note of retreat, the evening gun is\\nfired. The adjutant then comes to Attention, faces about, and commands Battalion, ATTENTION\\nand Present, ARMS so that the unit is at Present Arms when the first note of \u201cTo the Color\u201d or\\nnational anthem is sounded. The adjutant then faces about and executes Present Arms. The\\nadjutant\u2019s Salute is the signal for the band to begin playing \u201cTo the Color.\u201d\\n\\uf06c At the last note of \u201cTo the Color\u201d or the national anthem, the adjutant faces about, commands\\nOrder, ARMS, and then directs TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR UNITS. Unit commanders render\\nthe Hand Salute. The adjutant returns all Salutes with one Salute. This terminates the retreat\\nformation.\\nNote. When subordinate units stand at retreat, not as a part of a major command, the sequence is\\nthe same except the unit commander gives the commands.\\nCOMMAND RETREAT HISTORY\\n13-3. Command retreat is a ceremony conducted with all members of the command present. Normally, it is\\nconducted by a battalion or larger unit. In the 18th century, command retreat was a daily occurrence, not to\\nhonor the flag but as a signal for units to call the roll as a final accounting before reveille the following\\nmorning.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 13-1Chapter 13\\nCOMMAND RETREAT SEQUENCE OF EVENTS\\n13-4. The sequence of events for conducting command retreat are discussed herein:\\n\\uf06c The unit is formed in line formation facing the flag (if possible). Subunits may be in mass\\nformation. Subunits are brought to Attention at the approach of the commander and their staff, or\\nat a predesignated signal.\\n\\uf06c The COT forms their staff in line, takes their position two steps in front of the staff, and marches\\nthem to a position centered on and in front of the line of troops. The COT gives the proper\\ncommands to have themselves and their staff facing the line of troops when halted.\\n\\uf06c The adjutant, as soon as the staff is halted and without command, moves from their position with\\nthe staff to a position midway between the COT and the line of unit commanders. The adjutant\\ncommands REPORT. All unit commanders salute and report in succession from right to left \u201cSir\\nor Ma\u2019am, company all present or accounted for.\u201d The adjutant returns each Salute. The adjutant\\nthen commands Present, ARMS, faces about, Salutes, and reports to the COT \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, all\\npresent or accounted for.\u201d\\n\\uf06c The COT returns the Salute and directs POST. The adjutant moves to their position with the staff.\\nThe COT commands Order, ARMS.\\n\\uf06c The left flank member of the staff gives the commands to move the staff from behind the COT to\\na position two steps in front of the COT. The COT commands Parade, REST. If a band or field\\nmusic is to be used, the commander comes to Attention at the appointed time and commands\\nSOUND RETREAT. They then return to Parade Rest.\\n\\uf06c On the last note of \u201cRetreat,\u201d the evening gun is fired and the COT commands Battalion,\\nATTENTION and Present, ARMS. The COT then executes About Face and commands\\nthemselves and their staff to Present, ARMS. The commander\u2019s Salute is the signal for the band\\nto begin playing \u201cTo the Color\u201d or the national anthem as the flag is lowered.\\n\\uf06c After the last note of music, the COT commands themselves and their staff to Order, ARMS,\\nfaces about, commands Order, ARMS and directs TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR UNITS. The\\nunit commanders render the Hand Salute. The COT returns all Salutes with one Salute. The COT\\nthen marches their staff away or dismisses them.\\nSECTION II \u2013 REVEILLE\\n13-5. Reveille was not originally intended as honors to the flag. In 1812, it was a drum call to signify that\\nSoldiers should rise for day duty and sentries should leave off night challenging. As time passed, reveille\\ncame to denote when the flag was raised in the morning and honors paid to it.\\nREVEILLE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS\\n13-6. The sequence of events for conducting reveille are discussed herein:\\n\\uf06c The unit is formed facing the flag 5 minutes (if possible) before the sounding of reveille. Four\\nminutes before the sounding of reveille, the adjutant or other appointed officer (normally the duty\\nofficer) takes their position centered on the line of troops, commands the unit to ATTENTION,\\nand commands REPORT.\\n\\uf06c All subunits (companies, batteries, or troops) report in succession from right to left, \u201cSir or\\nMa\u2019am, _____ Company, all present or accounted for,\u201d or \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, _____ Company,\\n____ Soldiers absent.\u201d Salutes are exchanged with each report.\\n\\uf06c The adjutant commands Parade, REST and then assumes Parade Rest themselves. If a band is\\npresent, about 30 seconds before reveille, the adjutant commands ATTENTION, directs SOUND\\nREVEILLE, commands Present, ARMS, and then faces about. The adjutant\u2019s Salute is the signal\\nfor the band to sound reveille and to fire the morning gun. When reveille is sounded by a recording,\\nthe call ATTENTION is sounded about 30 seconds before reveille. This ensures that the adjutant\\nhas sufficient time to command the units to Present, ARMS before the first note of reveille.\\n13-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Retreats and Reveilles\\n\\uf06c After the last note of reveille has sounded, the adjutant terminates their Salute, faces about,\\ncommands Order, ARMS, and then directs TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR UNITS. The adjutant\\nreturns all Salutes with one Salute. This terminates the ceremony.\\nNote. When a unit conducts the reveille ceremony not as a member of a major command, battalion,\\nor company, the sequence of events remains the same except the unit commander gives all\\ncommands.\\nCOMMAND REVEILLE HISTORY\\n13-7. Command reveille is conducted with all members of the command present. Normally, command\\nreveille is conducted by a battalion or larger unit. Command reveille was conducted as a troop in 1812 and\\nwas used to muster the unit or for roll call.\\nCOMMAND REVEILLE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS\\n13-8. The sequence of events for conducting command reveille are discussed herein:\\n\\uf06c The unit is formed in a line formation facing the flag, if possible. Subunits may be in mass\\nformation. Subunits are commanded to Attention at the approach of the commander and their staff.\\n\\uf06c The COT takes their post two steps in front of and centered on their staff, commands Forward,\\nMARCH, and marches their staff to a position centered on and in front of the line of troops. The\\nCOT gives the proper commands to halt their staff in a position facing the line of troops.\\n\\uf06c As soon as the staff is halted by the COT, the adjutant moves (without command) from their\\nposition with the staff to a position midway between the COT and the line of unit commanders.\\nThe adjutant commands Present, ARMS, faces the COT, salutes, and reports \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, the\\nbattalion (brigade) is formed.\u201d\\n\\uf06c The COT returns the Salute and directs the adjutant to receive the reports. The adjutant faces about\\nand commands Order, ARMS and REPORT.\\n\\uf06c Unit commanders salute and report, in succession from right to left, \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, ____\\nCompany, all present or accounted for.\u201d The adjutant returns each unit commander\u2019s Salute.\\nAfter all unit commanders have reported, the adjutant faces the COT, salutes, and reports \u201cSir or\\nMa\u2019am, all present or accounted for.\u201d The COT returns the Salute and directs the adjutant to\\npublish the orders.\\n\\uf06c The adjutant faces about without saluting and commands ATTENTION TO ORDERS. The\\nadjutant then reads any orders or makes any announcements the COT wishes to publish. The\\nadjutant, on completion of the publishing of orders, faces about and takes their post with the staff\\nwithout saluting.\\n\\uf06c When the adjutant is in position, the left flank staff member commands Right, FACE; Forward,\\nMARCH; Column Left, MARCH; Column Left, MARCH. When the staff is centered on the\\nCOT, they then command Staff, HALT; Left, FACE. About 30 seconds before the sounding of\\nreveille, the COT commands Present, ARMS, executes About Face and commands Staff, Present,\\nARMS. Reveille is then sounded either by record, field music, or band as the flag is raised.\\n\\uf06c At the first note of \u201cReveille,\u201d the morning gun is fired. After the last note of music, the COT\\ncommands Staff, Order, ARMS, executes About Face, and commands Order, ARMS; they then\\ndirect, TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR UNITS. The unit commanders salute. The COT returns all\\nSalutes with one Salute. They then march their staff away or dismiss them. This terminates the\\nceremony.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 13-3This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 14\\nFunerals\\nThe funerals of Soldiers, more than any other ceremony, have followed an old pattern\\nas the living honor the brave dead. Military funeral honors reflects the high regard and\\nrespect accorded to military service and demonstrates military professionalism to the\\nNation. Military funeral honors is how the Soldiers and leaders of this great Nation\\nshow their gratitude for those who faithfully defended this country, during times of\\nboth war and peace.\\nSECTION I \u2013 HISTORY\\n14-1. Funeral services of great magnificence evolved as custom (from what is known about early Christian\\nmourning) in the 6th century. To this day, no religious ceremonies are conducted with more pomp than those\\nintended to commemorate the departed.\\n14-2. The first general mourning proclaimed in America was on the death of Benjamin Franklin in 1791.\\nThe second was the death of George Washington in 1799. The deep and widespread grief occasioned by the\\ndeath of the first President assembled a great number of people for the purpose of paying him a last tribute\\nof respect. On 18 December 1799 attended by military honors and the simplest but grandest ceremonies of\\nreligion, his body was deposited in the family vault at Mount Vernon, Virginia.\\n14-3. Several military traditions employed today have been brought forward from the past:\\n\\uf06c Reversed arms, displayed by one opponent on the battlefield, signaled that a truce was requested\\nso that the dead and wounded could be carried off and the dead buried.\\n\\uf06c Today\u2019s customary three volleys fired over a grave probably originated as far back as the Roman\\nEmpire. The Roman funeral rites of casting dirt three times on the coffin constituted the \u201cburial.\u201d\\nIt was customary among the Romans to call the dead three times by name, which ended the funeral\\nceremony, after which the friends and relatives of the deceased pronounced the word \u201cvale\u201d\\n(farewell) three times as they departed from the tomb. In more recent history, three musket volleys\\nwere fired to announce that the burying of the dead was completed and the burial party was ready\\nfor battle again.\\n\\uf06c The custom of using a caisson to carry a coffin most likely had its origins in the 1800s when\\nhorse-drawn caissons that pulled artillery pieces also doubled as a conveyance to clear fallen\\nSoldiers from the battlefield.\\n\\uf06c In the mid to late 1800s a funeral procession of a mounted officer or enlisted Service member was\\naccompanied by a riderless horse in mourning caparison followed by a hearse. It was also a custom\\nto have the boots of the deceased thrown over the saddle with heels to the front signifying that\\ntheir march was ended.\\nSECTION II \u2013 GENERAL INFORMATION\\n14-4. Military funerals have been an Army requirement for quite some time, and rightfully so. Military\\nmembers have honorably served their country and have perished in the defense of the Nation, or later on in\\nlife. The service and commitment to the country and their sacrifices are acknowledged by dedicating\\nresources and personnel to assist in the funeral or graveside ceremony and provide burial honors. Soldiers on\\nactive duty status, retirees, and Medal of Honor recipients receive a highly trained and dedicated nine-person\\ndetail to provide burial support and honors. Veterans receive a minimum of a two military personnel detail\\nto fold and present a folded American flag to the next of kin (NOK), and a bugler to play \u201cTaps\u201d at the\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 14-1Chapter 14\\ngravesite ceremony. Special circumstances may require a special full honor detail with more dedicated\\nresources and personnel.\\n14-5. Every funeral service is going to be different and the funeral honor team\u2019s requirement are going to\\ncontinually change with each funeral. The funeral director, the family or person authorized to direct\\ndisposition of human remains (PADD), the casualty assistance officer (known as CAO), and the chaplain or\\nclergy are all going to coordinate the funeral ceremony for a fallen Soldier and family member and they are\\nall going to have certain requests. The full honor detail requires the team to salute the fallen upon arrival,\\ncarry the casket or urn to the gravesite, have the chaplain participate in final words and remarks, salute the\\nfallen once again, fire three-round volley, play \u201cTaps,\u201d fold flag, and present flag to NOK. The two-person\\ndetail will, at a minimum, salute the fallen upon entering the gravesite or final resting place, play \u201cTaps,\u201d\\nfold and then present Color to NOK or PADD.\\nNote. The acronym NCOIC is used when discussing the role for the noncommissioned officer in\\ncharge of the funeral honor team. Sometimes that role will be filled by an officer in charge (OIC),\\nbut for simplicity and clarity we will use the term NCOIC throughout this chapter.\\n14-6. Funeral detail NCOICs will develop their own unit funeral detail standard operating procedures (SOPs)\\nmeeting the minimum Soldier requirements, and then be certified by their unit CSM. The detail NCOIC will\\ntrain their team to conduct all aspects of the funeral team\u2019s functions flawlessly. Every gravesite is going to\\nbe different just like every chapel, but it is the fundamentals that the honor team must get right. Each separate\\ndetail team (pallbearers, firing team, bugler, flag folders, and NCOIC) must know the procedures and conduct\\nthem as accurately and flawlessly as possible. The firing party must move as one, fire as one, stack weapons\\nwith everyone being in sync with one another. The flag must be folded and presented perfectly. The presenter\\nmust memorize and rehearse their tasks until it becomes second nature to them. The goal of the funeral honor\\nteam is to provide military burial honors as prestigiously and gracefully as possible.\\n14-7. The firing detail will be between five and eight personnel with one of the detail members giving\\ncommands and acting as the firing party NCOIC. If the unit SOP establishes five firers for each funeral team\\nwith one NCOIC, then there are six people for pallbearer duties if a separate detail is not provided. The\\nfuneral detail NCOIC must be the one to determine the best way to provide gravesite honors and then rehearse\\nand practice their functions until it becomes muscle memory.\\nINDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITIES\\n14-8. The Casualty Assistance Center (known as CAC) coordinates burial honors, for deceased Army\\npersonnel, including active duty and retired personnel as well as eligible RCs and veterans when requested\\nby the family. Active duty Soldiers and retirees will receive burial with full military funeral honors, provided\\nby a nine-person funeral detail as described in paragraph 14-20. Eligible members of the RC and veterans\\nwill also receive funeral honors from a two-person detail. Medal of Honor recipients are entitled to full\\nmilitary funeral honors, regardless of status.\\n14-9. The command or activity responsible for providing military funeral honors will ensure there is an active\\nsearch for a bugler (see AR 600-25). A live bugler is preferred for all active duty and veteran funeral services;\\nevery effort must be made to obtain a live bugler to play \u201cTaps\u201d (see AR 600-25). However, if a live bugler\\nis unavailable \u201cTaps\u201d may be played on a ceremonial bugle which is a suitable electronic device. Electronic\\ndevices are only used as a last resort. For assistance searching for a live bugler visit the U.S. Army Bands\\nwebsite. The family of the deceased (or its representative) may request another clergyman to officiate in lieu\\nof a military chaplain. A civilian clergyman can conduct all religious elements of a military funeral or\\ninterment. More information about religious support to funerals and memorial events can be found in\\nATP 1-05.02.\\n14-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Funerals\\n14-10. The desires of the family are given the fullest consideration possible in the selection of elements\\ninvolved, but the funeral is conducted as prescribed in this manual.

The commanding officer or their representative, in coordination with the\\nPADD, cemetery superintendent, and the funeral director makes the funeral arrangements and\\nsupervises the conduct of the funeral.\\nPERSONAL CONDUCT\\n14-11. When honorary pallbearers are desired, they are selected by the family of the deceased, or its\\nrepresentative, or by the commanding officer if the family wishes. As a rule, no more than 12 honorary\\npallbearers should be selected.\\n14-12. At a military funeral, persons in military uniform attending in their individual capacity face the\\ncasket and execute the Hand Salute at the following times: when honors, if any, are sounded; at any time the\\ncasket is being moved as seen in figure 14-1 (unless the uniformed persons are walking); during cannon\\nsalutes, if sounded; during the firing of volleys; and while \u201cTaps\u201d is being played:\\n\\uf06c Honorary pallbearers in uniform conform to those instructions when not in motion.\\n\\uf06c Military personnel in civilian clothes in the above cases, and during the service at the grave, stand\\nat Attention, uncover, and hold the headdress over the left shoulder with the right hand over the\\nheart.

During the religious graveside service, all personnel bow their heads at the words \u201cLet us pray\u201d for\\nacknowledgment of religious activities. Those choosing to pray could pray as they choose. All mourners at\\ngraveside, except the active pallbearers, follow the example of the officiating chaplain. If the chaplain\\nuncovers, they uncover; if the chaplain remains covered, they remain covered. When the officiating chaplain\\nwears a biretta (clerical headpiece) during the graveside service, all personnel, as indicated above, uncover.\\nWhen the officiating chaplain wears a yarmulke (Jewish skull cap), all personnel remain covered.\\n14-14. The remains of a member of the armed forces who died while on active duty may be consigned\\ndirectly to a national cemetery from a military installation. In such cases, the cemetery superintendent will,\\nregardless of time of arrival, if not otherwise provided for, engage a funeral director to receive the remains\\nat the common carrier terminal, hold the remains at their establishment until the date of the funeral, if\\nnecessary, and deliver the remains to the cemetery. The superintendent will not authorize a funeral director\\nto render any other service incident to the interment.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 14-5Chapter 14\\n14-15. The word \u201cchapel\u201d is interpreted to include the church, home, or other place where services are held,\\nother than the service at the grave. The word \u201ccasket\u201d is interpreted to include the receptacle containing the\\ncremated remains of the deceased.\\nPRESENTATION OF THE FLAG\\n14-16. Funeral honors ceremonies conducted by the Army will use the standardized DOD language for the\\npresentation of the flag to the designated flag recipient. The verbiage below will be used when presenting the\\nU.S. flag during the funeral service. The Service member presenting the flag to NOK of the eligible\\nbeneficiary will be from the parent Service branch and oversee the burial honor team.\\nUse when presenting the U.S. flag during the funeral service:\\n\u201cOn behalf of the President of the United States, (the U.S. Army, the U.S. Marine\\nCorps, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force, or the U.S. Coast Guard), and a grateful\\nNation, please accept this flag as a symbol of our appreciation for your loved one\\'s\\nhonorable and faithful service.\u201d\\n14-17. In some situations, there will be more than one family member to be presented the American flag\\nduring the gravesite service and the NCOIC will use the CAO or military chaplain to provide the secondary\\nfolded flag to the NCOIC for presentation. The NCOIC will coordinate with the CAO or military chaplain to\\nmove to their location, face each other, salute as mentioned later in this chapter, and then present the flag to\\nthe next individual.\\nSECTION III \u2013 TYPES OF HONORS AND CLASSES OF MILITARY FUNERALS\\n14-18. Military funerals are divided into two classes: chapel service, followed by movement to the grave or\\nplace of local disposition with the prescribed escort; and graveside service only. Chapel service may not be\\nrequested by the funeral director or PADD, but they may request military honors done graveside then funeral\\nhonor teams will only have to perform their duties at the gravesite.\\nTYPES OF MILITARY FUNERAL HONORS\\n14-19. The Army will either provide full honors with a minimum of a nine-Soldier detail team, or veteran\\nhonors with a minimum of a two-person detail. Circumstances sometimes require a special full honor detail\\nto be assembled for a military funeral. Burial honors and the composition of funeral escorts are described in\\nchapter 7 of AR 600-25.\\nFULL HONORS (NINE-SOLDIER DETAIL)\\n14-20. Full military honors are rendered in the event of the death of a Soldier on active duty, retirees, and\\nMedal of Honor recipients (regardless of status). Full military funeral honors consist of a nine-Soldier detail\\nled by an NCOIC (with the appropriate rank and branch of the deceased), six Soldiers to act as pallbearers\\nand conduct firing party duties (dual function), a bugler, and a military chaplain.\\n14-21. The funeral detail NCOIC makes all coordination with the CAC and makes all necessary\\narrangements with the members of the funeral detail. The pallbearers are responsible for the carrying of the\\ncasket from the hearse to the location of the ceremony, and to the burial site, when requested. The pallbearers\\ncould serve in a dual function role responsible to act as the firing party during full military honors, when\\nneeded. The bugler is responsible for the playing of \u201cTaps\u201d during the burial site ceremony, at the conclusion\\nof the benediction later discussed in this chapter. If resources permit, a larger funeral detail may be provided,\\nwhich is composed of all the elements of the nine-person funeral detail, and may also include the following:\\n\\uf06c Color guard.\\n\\uf06c Separate firing party (no more than eight, or less than five rifle-bearers).\\n14-6 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Funerals\\n\\uf06c Hearse (caisson).\\n\\uf06c Honorary pallbearers.\\n\\uf06c Personal Colors (if appropriate).\\n\\uf06c Escort unit(s) (appropriate for the rank of the deceased).\\nVETERANS HONORS (TWO-PERSON DETAIL)\\n14-22. A two-person detail consists of an OIC or NCOIC (appropriate for the rank of the deceased), an\\nenlisted Soldier, and a bugler to play \u201cTaps.\u201d The two-person military funeral honor team performs flag\\nfolding and flag presentation to NOK, or designated personnel for a deceased military veteran. The flag will\\nbe presented by a member of the veteran\\'s branch of service and that member is overall in charge of the honor\\nteam. \u201cTaps\u201d will be played by a live bugler or an additional detail member using an electronic device. If no\\nbugler is obtained prior to the funeral ceremony then coordination will be done to use an electronic recording.\\nSPECIAL FULL HONOR TEAMS (TWENTY-ONE SOLDIER DETAIL)\\n14-23. Special full honor teams are often composed for special circumstance or when Army leadership are\\ntasked or compelled to provide additional honor ceremony support for situations such as the death of a Soldier\\nkilled in action, general officer, and CSM or sergeant major. Special full honor teams will often be led by\\nsenior NCOs, have more personnel and support provided by the tasked unit, and have senior leaders in\\nattendance. The person who presents the flag to NOK or PADD must be the same rank or higher than the\\nSoldier or veteran being laid to rest.\\n14-24. Special full honor teams could be assembled with escorts, Color guards, pallbearers, firing detail,\\nand band personnel. Special full honor ceremonies could have flyovers depending if the Soldier or veteran\\nbeing laid to rest meets the criteria established in AR 600-25. Special full honors are sometimes a significant\\nevent possibly covered by local and national media organizations.\\n14-25. Special full honors for a general officer in active service will require at the gravesite service a\\nseven-person firing party with one NCOIC to fire the three-round volley. General officers will also have a\\ncannon salute prior to the final benediction with the number of rounds prescribed in AR 600-25, table 3-1.\\nCLASSES OF MILITARY FUNERALS\\n14-26. Military funerals are divided into two classes: chapel service, followed by movement to the grave or\\nplace of local disposition with the prescribed escort; and graveside service only. This manual will provide\\nthe procedures for each class of military funerals with two different types (full military honors and veteran\\nhonors).\\nFUNERAL WITH CHAPEL SERVICE (FULL MILITARY HONORS\u2014NINE-PERSON FUNERAL\\nHONORS DETAIL)\\n14-27. Use the following procedures to conduct a funeral in a chapel with full military honors. Most military\\nhonor teams will not have separate pallbearers and firing party so if the family wants Soldiers to serve as\\npallbearers than the honor team will have a dual function role. This manual will address both funeral team\\nconfigurations. Many funeral homes have a chapel on location and the funeral detail NCOIC will need to\\ncoordinate with the funeral director of their involvement at the service. The following is conducted at the\\nchapel if the Service member is being brought to the chapel from another location, or their presence and\\nservice is requested to carry the deceased from the chapel at the conclusion of the chapel service:\\n\\uf06c At the chapel, the funeral detail forms as shown in figure 14-2 on page 14-8. The NCOIC has all\\nparticipants at the position of Parade Rest. The NCOIC and the pallbearers will be on line at\\nnormal intervals facing the chapel and close to the designated arrival point of the conveyance. The\\nNCOIC positions themselves at the end of the pallbearers so that the conveyance passes them first\\nas it approaches.\\n\\uf06c If resources permit and there is a separate firing party, then the firing party will form two ranks\\nfacing each other and form an aisle from the conveyance to the entrance of the chapel.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 14-7Chapter 14\\nFigure 14-2. Funeral detail formation\\n\\uf06c Members of the immediate family, relatives, friends of the deceased, and the CAO will be seated\\nin the chapel before the conveyance arrives and the casket is taken into the chapel. Members of\\nthe immediate family and relatives occupy pews (seats) to the right (front) of the chapel or where\\ndesignated from the funeral director.\\n\\uf06c As the conveyance comes into view, the funeral detail NCOIC will command the pallbearers to\\nATTENTION and render a solo hand salute as the conveyance approaches. Once the conveyance\\nstops in front of the chapel, the NCOIC will automatically Order Arms\u2014\\n\\uf0a7 If a separate firing party exists, the funeral detail NCOIC addresses the entire detail and\\ncommands Escort, ATTENTION; Pallbearers, Center, FACE. On the command Center,\\nFACE, just the pallbearers face the designated arrival point of the conveyance (see\\nfigure 14-2).\\n\\uf0a7 As the conveyance approaches, the NCOIC commands Present, ARMS and salutes to honor\\nthe national Color draped over the casket, and commands Order, ARMS after the conveyance\\nhalts.\\n14-8 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Funerals\\n\\uf06c If necessary, the NCOIC repositions the pallbearers at the rear of the conveyance as seen in\\nfigure 14-3.\\n\\uf06c After the funeral director opens the doors of the hearse, the NCOIC Present Arms until the casket\\nenters the chapel:\\n\\uf0a7 If a firing party is present, they will also Present Arms as the door to the hearse is open.\\n\\uf0a7 The firing party will remain in Present Arms until the NCOIC commands Order, ARMS.\\n\\uf06c The senior pallbearer, designated position 5, and the pallbearer in position 1 grasp the handles at\\nthe head of the casket. (The union of the flag is draped over this end.) They walk backwards,\\npulling the casket from the conveyance, allowing the pallbearers in positions 2 and 3 to grasp\\nhandles on the casket. The pallbearers handle the remains in a dignified, reverent, and military\\nmanner, ensuring the casket is carried level and feet first at all times (see figure 14-1 on page 14-5).\\nFigure 14-3. Carrying the casket inside\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 14-9Chapter 14\\n\\uf06c For funerals where there is a separate firing party, once the casket is borne between the firing party\\nmembers, and taken into the chapel, the NCOIC commands Order, ARMS. The firing party\\ndeparts under the control of the firing party commander and travels to the gravesite if\\ntransportation is available. Once at the gravesite, the firing party prepares for the gravesite\\nceremony. The bugler, if not already at the gravesite, travels with the firing party.\\n\\uf06c Having entered the chapel, the pallbearers carry the casket to the front of the church. If a church\\ntruck is available, the casket is placed on the truck at the entrance of the chapel and pushed to the\\nfront by the senior pallbearer and one other. The pallbearers then take seats, as directed by the\\nchaplain, until the conclusion of the chapel service.\\n\\uf06c For information on how to display the U.S. flag on the casket, either closed or half-couch, consult\\nDA Pam 638-2, appendix E.\\n\\uf06c After the service, the pallbearers either carry the casket or push it on a church truck from the front\\nof the chapel to the exit. The casket is placed directly into the conveyance with the senior and\\nnumber 1 pallbearers being the last to release their casket handles. The funeral director secures the\\ndoors of the conveyance.\\n\\uf06c The pallbearers board their transportation and travel to the interment site to prepare for the\\ngraveside ceremony. The funeral party travels in the following order (see figure 14-4):\\n\\uf0a7 Clergy.\\n\\uf0a7 Conveyance with casket.\\n\\uf0a7 Active pallbearers.\\n\\uf0a7 Personal flag (if appropriate).\\n\\uf0a7 Family and CAO.\\n\\uf0a7 Friends.\\nNote. The funeral detail will need to swiftly move directly to the gravesite to establish where to\\nplace the firing party or to stack weapons if the firing party is performing a dual function as the\\npallbearers. The NCOIC will place the bugler, and then prepare the detail to perform their gravesite\\nduties. The funeral detail NCOIC must know the exact location of the cemetery and gravesite to\\neliminate the possibilities of issues.\\n14-10 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Funerals\\nFigure 14-4. Funeral procession\\n\\uf06c After the procession is formed, it travels directly to the gravesite. Upon arrival, the funeral detail\\nNCOIC positions themselves between the chaplain and the head of the gravesite. The pallbearers\\nform and remove the casket from the conveyance the same as previously outlined (see figure 14-5\\non page 14-12).\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 14-11Chapter 14\\nFigure 14-5. Graveside formation\\n\\uf06c Once the casket is removed from the conveyance, the NCOIC commands the firing party (if\\nresources permit a separate firing party) and bugler to Present Arms.\\n\\uf06c The pallbearers carry the casket, feet first, to the grave. Upon reaching the grave, the casket is\\nplaced on the lowering device. The pallbearers then execute the appropriate facing movement and\\nmarch off in two ranks toward the designated firing party location if they are conducting dual\\nfunctions. While marching, the pallbearers merge into single file in order to form one rank,\\n45 degrees off the foot of the casket. The firing party commander is positioned on the opposite\\nflank or centered to the rear of the formation (see figure 14-6 on page 14-14). At that time, the\\n14-12 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Funerals\\nfiring party commander will command the firing party to unstack their weapons, which have been\\npre-positioned under guard at the gravesite, and then to stand at Parade Rest during the gravesite\\nservice:\\n\\uf0a7 If there is a separate firing party, then the pallbearers will move to a predesignated location\\nto observe the funeral ceremony.\\n\\uf0a7 The pallbearers will stand at parade rest until the three-round volley and the playing of \u201cTaps.\u201d\\n\\uf06c When the casket is placed over the grave, and the pallbearers march from the casket to become\\nthe firing party or spectators, the NCOIC terminates their salute and moves from their place at the\\nhead of the casket in order to permit the chaplain to conduct the graveside service. The NCOIC\\nshould move to a location where they still face the family but does not interfere with the service.\\nOnce in position, they assume the position of Parade Rest until the service is completed.\\n\\uf06c After Parade Rest has been commanded, the chaplain conducts the graveside service. At the\\nconclusion of the benediction, the NCOIC returns to their position at the head of the casket, renders\\na hand salute, which also cues the firing party commander to commence the firing party sequence,\\nas outlined in paragraph 14-40. The CAO and other military members in attendance also execute\\nPresent Arms. The firing party fires three volleys of blank cartridges, assumes the position of\\nPresent Arms at the command of the firing party commander, and remains in this position until\\nthe conclusion of \u201cTaps.\u201d The bugler, positioned near the firing party and in view of NOK, sounds\\n\u201cTaps\u201d immediately following the firing party assuming Present Arms.\\n\\uf06c At the conclusion of \u201cTaps,\u201d the firing party comes to Order Arms at the command of the firing\\nparty commander, and if they are performing a dual function they restack their weapons in a\\nceremonial manner. After the stacking of weapons is completed, the firing party forms into two\\nranks and marches in the most direct route back to the lowering device platform so they can\\nperform the ceremonial folding of the interment flag. The CAO and military members in\\nattendance terminate their Salute:\\n\\uf0a7 If there are a separate firing party and pallbearer detail, then the pallbearers will be the\\ndesignated members to conduct the folding of the flag.\\n\\uf0a7 The senior pallbearer will quietly march the detail directly to their original positions around\\nthe casket.\\n\\uf06c The pallbearers raise the flag from the casket and hold it in a horizontal position waist high and\\ncomplete the folding sequence without letting the flag touch the casket as seen in figure 14-6 on\\npage 14-14. As the flag is folded, it is passed to the senior pallbearer at the head of the casket, who\\nmakes the final tuck and inspection. (See appendix I for detailed information on folding the flag.)\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 14-13Chapter 14\\nFigure 14-6. Flag folding detail\\n\\uf06c After the flag is folded, the senior pallbearer executes a Right Face and places the flag at chest\\nlevel, point of flag away from the individual receiving it, and into the hands of the funeral detail\\nNCOIC. The NCOIC conducts a final inspection of the flag, and then salutes the flag for 3 seconds\\nbefore accepting it from the senior pallbearer. The NCOIC could fix any issues with the flag prior\\nto rendering the Hand Salute. The senior pallbearer salutes the flag for a total of 9 seconds\\n(3-seconds up, 3-second salute, and then 3 seconds to lower) after presenting it to the NCOIC.\\n\\uf06c The NCOIC allows the senior pallbearer to quietly march the flag-folding detail back to their\\npositions at the firing detail location where they will quietly unstack weapons and stand at Parade\\nRest until the completion of the ceremony, and guests depart the location, if time is not an issue.\\n\\uf06c The NCOIC then moves by the most direct route to NOK who is to receive the flag. The NCOIC\\nspins the flag clockwise with their left hand over their right hand, point toward them and away\\nfrom the person receiving it. The NCOIC kneels down in front of NOK for flag presentation and\\nrenders the remarks, \u201cOn behalf of the President of the United States, the United States Army, and\\na grateful Nation, please accept this flag as a symbol of our appreciation for your loved one\u2019s\\nhonorable and faithful service.\u201d After the flag is presented, the NCOIC stands at the Position of\\nAttention, and salutes the flag one final time. The NCOIC executes the proper facing movement\\nand then moves directly to their original position. The flag is handed to the designated person as\\nseen in figure 14-7.\\n14-14 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Funerals\\nFigure 14-7. Presentation of the flag\\n\\uf06c Once the ceremony is complete and all guests have vacated the area, the firing party NCOIC has\\neach member of the firing detail clear their weapons. The NCOIC is responsible for ensuring all\\nweapons have been properly cleared and then has the detail police up all brass.\\nGRAVESIDE SERVICE\\n14-28. For a funeral without chapel service, all elements of a military funeral are present and used as\\npreviously described in paragraph 14-27. However, if troops are not conveniently available, or if the family\\nwishes to eliminate other elements, the following are used (see figure 14-8 on page 14-16):\\n\\uf06c Military clergy (if available and requested).\\n\\uf06c OIC or NCOIC, appropriate to the grade of the deceased (see AR 600-25).\\n\\uf06c Active pallbearers or firing party.\\n\\uf06c Separate firing party (if resources permit).\\n\\uf06c Bugler.\\n\\uf06c Personal Color bearer (if appropriate).\\nNote. These elements are in position at the graveside before the arrival of the remains.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 14-15Chapter 14\\nFigure 14-8. Graveside service\\nVETERANS HONORS AT GRAVESIDE SERVICE (TWO-PERSON DETAIL)\\n14-29. A two-person honor detail provides graveside honors by the playing of \u201cTaps\u201d and the flag folding\\nand presentation to the appropriate family members. If a live bugler is unavailable, the designated person\\nresponsible for the funeral honors may authorize instead the playing of a recording of \u201cTaps\u201d and will ensure\\nthat a quality recording is available (see AR 600-25). If a live bugler is not available then an additional detail\\nmember will be needed to play \u201cTaps.\u201d That bugler will need to acquire a bugle, two sets of batteries, and an\\nextra flag to use during the ceremony if the funeral director did not get one. The use of an alternative\\nelectronic device is authorized although highly discouraged. Use the following procedures to conduct a\\nmilitary funeral with a two-person honor detail:\\n\\uf06c Once the Army CAC is alerted, it arranges for the two-person military honor detail to arrive at the\\ninterment site at the appropriate time to provide graveside honors:\\n\\uf0a7 The leader of the detail has many responsibilities to include contacting the funeral director to\\nconfirm the date, time, and location of the interment service. The leader ensures that the\\nfuneral director has obtained a flag for the ceremony. The detail leader will bring a backup\\nflag to the ceremony in case it is needed.\\n\\uf0a7 The leader confirms and coordinates participation of the second member of the detail.\\n\\uf0a7 When all coordination is completed, the final pre-interment activity is to train and rehearse\\nthe detail. A mandatory training item is to carefully watch a video demonstration tape\\nprovided by DOD to each installation.\\n\\uf0a7 On the day of the interment ceremony, the detail leader confirms arrangements with the\\nfuneral director and coordinates necessary cues at the interment site.\\n14-16 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Funerals\\n\\uf0a7 The two-person detail will line up on the curbside with their backs towards the gravesite, side\\nby side.\\n\\uf06c The rendition of \u201cTaps\u201d may be by performed by a bugler or by an electronic device:\\n\\uf0a7 The CAC actively searches for a bugler (military or civilian). Bugler support may be from an\\nArmy band (Active or RC), contracted, or voluntary.\\n\\uf0a7 If a live bugler is not available, an additional person will have to perform the role as a bugler\\nusing a digital bugle. The CAC issues a digital bugle that plays a prerecorded \u201cTaps.\u201d Ensure\\nthe bugle has two sets of batteries.\\n\\uf0a7 The person playing the bugle should use the same precision that an Army bugler is trained to\\nperform. See TC 1-19.10, appendix F, for the proper way to hold the instrument and how to\\nexecute the manual of instruments.\\n\\uf0a7 If a bugler is not available, the CAC uses the high-quality recording of the U.S. Army Band\\nbugler provided by the Office of the Secretary of Defense on CD. Many national and private\\ncemeteries have sound systems that play \u201cTaps\u201d at the interment site. However, CACs cannot\\nassume availability of such systems and must have enough high-quality, portable CD players\\nto provide their own sound system at funerals. (A portable CD player that can be easily heard\\nby all attendees at the interment ceremony is recommended.) Before departing for a funeral,\\nthe detail leader must determine if a sound system is available or if the CAC must provide a\\nsound system to the honors detail.\\n\\uf06c The detail arrives at the interment site early and conducts a reconnaissance and rehearsal. Part of\\nthe reconnaissance is the selection of a location for the bugler or CD player that will sound \u201cTaps.\u201d\\nThe detail leader sets up and tests the CD player, ensuring the unit and its remote controls are\\nworking properly and that it is out of sight of the family:\\n\\uf0a7 When everything is prepared, the detail leader positions the detail in their designated place\\nbefore the arrival of the funeral cortege. The detail leader positions themselves near the\\nrecording device; the other members(s) will be positioned near the foot of the grave.\\n\\uf0a7 The leader brings the team to Attention and Present Arms as the remains are carried to the\\ngravesite by civilian pallbearers. The detail leader commands Order, ARMS when the casket\\nis placed on the lowering device.\\n\\uf0a7 At the conclusion of the committal service, the detail leader directs the bugler to sound \u201cTaps\u201d\\nelectronically. Installations must ensure that honor detail training directs that the digital bugle\\nmovements are executed to Army bands military occupational specialty standard, or the\\nrecording device be positioned out of sight of the family and be played in a dignified manner\\nas shown in the training video from DOD.\\n\\uf0a7 The person playing the digital bugle should use the same precision that an Army band bugler\\nis trained to perform. See TC 1-19.10, appendix F, for the proper way to hold the instrument\\nand how to execute the manual of instruments.\\n\\uf0a7 Although the CD player should be out of sight, activating the \u201cplay\u201d button should be\\nperformed with precision and distinction by bending over, activating the recorder, and then\\nstepping back one step and assuming the Position of Attention.\\n\\uf0a7 Each detail member will Present Arms during \u201cTaps\u201d and will execute Order Arms at its\\ncompletion. At the conclusion of \u201cTaps,\u201d the detail leader ensures the recording device is\\nturned off and then proceeds in a dignified and military manner to the head of the casket.\\n\\uf06c For flag folding, upon conclusion of \u201cTaps,\u201d the representative and their assistant move closer to\\nthe casket. When the flag is secured and raised, the detail takes three steps away from the mourners\\nand folds the flag. (See appendix I for detailed information on folding the flag.) When the flag is\\nproperly folded, the detail leader inspects and then salutes the flag for 3 seconds. The assistant\\nhands the flag to the detail leader, salutes the flag for 3 seconds, and posts to a position next to the\\nside or rear of the family.\\n\\uf06c After the assistant departs, the detail leader presents the flag to NOK using the following wording:\\n\u201cOn behalf of the President of the United States, the United States Army, and a grateful Nation,\\nplease accept this flag as a symbol of our appreciation for your loved one\u2019s honorable and faithful\\nservice.\u201d After presenting the flag, the detail leader moves to the Position of Attention and\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 14-17Chapter 14\\nconducts a slow salute to the flag. They then execute a facing movement and march out of sight\\nfrom the funeral ceremony. Presentation of the flag is previously discussed on pages 14-14 and\\n14-15.\\n\\uf06c Not all funerals will be authorized the human resources as outlined in this sequence of events;\\ntherefore, the NCOIC will extract those portions of the sequence that apply to their funeral detail\\ncontingent.\\n\\uf06c Additions to an element of the funeral detail not specifically addressed in this sequence of events\\nare not authorized. Requests for exceptions to policy will be directed to TRADOC.\\nSECTION IV \u2013 ADDITIONAL FUNERAL CONSIDERATIONS\\n14-30. Funeral details will have many other considerations which will have to be addressed by the NCOIC\\nor OIC. Although each funeral is similar in nature, there are many different events and considerations to be\\naware of. Cremated remains, cannon salutes, and participation of aviation are a few of the funeral\\nconsiderations addressed during the planning and execution of a funeral.\\nCREMATED REMAINS\\n14-31. When the remains are cremated and the ashes interred with military honors, the previously stated\\nprovisions, with necessary modifications, will govern:\\n\\uf06c For all phases of the funeral, where the cremated remains are carried by hand, one pallbearer is\\ndetailed to carry the receptacle (casket) containing the ashes and another is detailed to carry the\\nflag, folded into the shape of a cocked hat. The pallbearer carrying the flag is always positioned\\nto the right of the remains (see figure 14-9). When the receptacle is carried from the hearse into\\nthe chapel and from the chapel to the hearse, these two pallbearers are the only participants in the\\nceremony. During the procession to the gravesite, the receptacle and flag are carried by the two\\npallbearers followed by four additional pallbearers. When the receptacle has been placed on the\\ngravesite, all six pallbearers unfold the flag and hold it over the grave. (Honors are the same as a\\nflag-draped casket.)\\n14-18 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Funerals\\nFigure 14-9. Pallbearers for cremated remains\\n\\uf06c When the receptacle and flag are placed before the chancel of the chapel or transported to gravesite\\nby vehicle, the receptacle and folded flag are placed side by side. If the pallbearers walk to the\\ngravesite, the two bearers who carried the receptacle and the flag join the other four pallbearers\\nalready pre-positioned on either side of the hearse.\\n\\uf06c When no hearse is used, suitable transportation is provided for the receptacle, flag bearers, and the\\nother pallbearers.\\n\\uf06c When the remains are moved to a crematory and the ashes are to be interred with military honors\\nat a later time, the ceremony consists only of the escort to the crematory. All personnel salute as\\nthe remains are carried into the crematory. The firing of volleys and the sounding of \u201cTaps\u201d are\\nomitted. When the funeral ceremony is held at the crematory, and when no further honors are\\nanticipated, the volleys are fired and \u201cTaps\u201d is sounded at the discretion of the commanding\\nofficer.\\nNote. In this situation, the flag is carried left hand over right hand with the point forward.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 14-19Chapter 14\\nCEREMONY BEFORE SHIPMENT OF REMAINS\\n14-32. When the remains of a deceased Soldier are moved to a railway station or other point for shipment\\nto another place for interment or final disposition, funeral services are modified as necessary. When no further\\nmilitary honors are anticipated at the place of interment or final disposition, the volleys are fired and \u201cTaps\u201d\\nsounded at the discretion of the commanding officer. When military honors are anticipated at the place of\\nfinal disposition, the volleys and \u201cTaps\u201d are omitted.\\nCANNON SALUTE\\n14-33. When the funeral of a general officer on the active or retired list, who was entitled to a cannon salute,\\ntakes place at or near a military installation, guns equal to the number to which the officer was entitled (see\\nAR 600-25) may be fired at noon on the day of the funeral. The military installation mentioned in general\\norders will fire the prescribed salutes. Immediately preceding the benediction, a cannon salute corresponding\\nto the grade of the deceased (see AR 600-25) is fired at 5-second intervals. Following the benediction, three\\nvolleys of musketry are fired.\\nPARTICIPATION OF AVIATION\\n14-34. When aviation participates in a military funeral, it is timed so that the aircraft appear over the\\nprocession. Requirements for aviation participation can be found in AR 600-25.\\nPARTICIPATION OF RESERVE COMPONENTS\\n14-35. The RC, along with the active Army, are required to participate in funeral details. The Army National\\nGuard (ARNG) and U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) have a single point of contact (POC) in each ARNG state\\narea command (known as STARC) or USAR regional support command (known as RSC) to which a request\\nfor assistance can be made. When the active Army is unable to support the request, or it is more prudent for\\nthe RC unit to provide honors, the CAC contacts the RC POC at either the STARC or RSC for military\\nfuneral honors support. If the RC POC does not respond to the request for support within 2 hours, the CAC\\nshould again contact the RC POC. When the RC is unable to support the request for assistance, the CAC is\\nresponsible for providing the honors. The casualty and memorial affairs operations center, personnel\\ncommand will provide a list of RC POCs to the CACs. CACs should establish memorandums of agreement\\nwith RC POCs and other military organizations within their area of responsibility specifying requirements\\nand responsibilities.\\nPARTICIPATION OF FRATERNAL OR PATRIOTIC\\nORGANIZATIONS\\n14-36. The family or representative of the deceased may request fraternal or patriotic organizations, of\\nwhich the deceased was a member, to take part in the funeral service. With immediate family approval\\nfraternal or patriotic organizations may conduct graveside service at the conclusion of the military portion of\\nthe ceremony, signified by the flag presentation to NOK and escort departure from the cemetery.\\nDUTIES OF THE CHAPLAIN\\n14-37. The chaplain takes their position in front of the chapel before the arrival of the remains. The chaplain\\nprecedes the casket when it is carried from the hearse into the chapel and from the chapel to the hearse. While\\nthe remains are being placed in the hearse, they stand at the rear and to the side facing the hearse. When the\\nchaplain is wearing vestments, they may, at their discretion, proceed from the chancel to the sacristy (vestry)\\nat the conclusion of the chapel service and divest, joining the procession before it moves from the chapel.\\nThe chaplain then precedes the hearse to the graveside and precedes the casket to the grave.\\n14-20 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Funerals\\nPRELIMINARY ARRANGEMENTS\\n14-38. The OIC of a military funeral, the commander of the escort, the funeral director, and the\\nsuperintendent of the cemetery or their representative visit the places involved and make careful\\narrangements before the time set for the funeral. They determine the positions at the grave for the various\\nelements of the funeral and arrange for traffic control.\\nFLORAL TRIBUTES\\n14-39. In the absence of the chaplain, the chaplain\u2019s assistant helps the funeral director in arranging all\\nfloral tributes in the chapel. The commanding officer or their representative coordinates the necessary\\ntransportation with the funeral director for prompt transfer of floral tributes from the chapel to the gravesite.\\nThe vehicle bearing the floral tributes is loaded promptly at the conclusion of the chapel service. It precedes\\nthe funeral procession, moving as rapidly as practicable to the site of the grave. The funeral procession does\\nnot move from the chapel until the vehicle carrying the floral tributes has cleared the escort. The funeral\\ndirector or the cemetery representative is responsible for removing cards and making a record that gives a\\nbrief description of the floral piece pertaining to each card. After completion of the funeral services, the cards\\nand records are turned over to a member of the family of the deceased.\\nRULES FOR CEREMONIAL FIRING\\n14-40. For ceremonial firing, the firing party consists of not more than eight riflemen and not less than five\\nriflemen with one NCOIC (see figure 14-10 on page 14-22). The firing party is normally pre-positioned at\\nthe gravesite and facing in the direction that allows it to fire directly over the grave. However, care should\\nbe taken to ensure that rifles are fired at a 45-degree angle from the horizontal:\\n\\uf06c To load\u2014\\n\\uf0a7 Magazines or clips are loaded with three rounds before forming the firing party.\\n\\uf0a7 At the conclusion of the religious services or on the escort commander\u2019s command, the\\nNCOIC commands With blank ammunition, LOAD. At the command LOAD, each\\nrifle-bearer executes Port Arms, faces to the half right, and moves their right foot 10 inches\\nto the right to a position that gives them a firm, steady stance. The rifle-bearer then chambers\\na round, places the weapon in the safe position, and resumes Port Arms.\\n\\uf06c To fire by volley\u2014\\n\\uf0a7 When the rifle-bearers have completed the movements and the weapons are locked, the\\ncommands from the firing detail NCOIC are Ready, Aim, FIRE. At the command Ready,\\neach rifle-bearer moves the safety to the fire position. On the command Aim, the rifle is\\nshouldered with both hands with the muzzle to the front at an angle of 45 degrees from the\\nhorizontal. On the command of execution FIRE, the trigger is squeezed quickly, and the\\nweapon is immediately returned to Port Arms.\\n\\uf0a7 To continue the firing with weapons that function automatically (blank adapter), the\\ncommands Aim and FIRE are given and executed as previously prescribed. To continue the\\nfiring with weapons that must be manually operated to chamber another round (without blank\\nadapters), the commands Ready, Aim, FIRE are again given. On, the command Ready, each\\nrifle-bearer manually chambers the next round. The commands Aim and FIRE are then given\\nand executed as previously prescribed.\\n\\uf0a7 When the third round has been fired and the riflemen have resumed Port Arms, the NCOIC\\ncommands CEASE FIRING. Every rifle-bearer immediately place their weapon on safe,\\nassume the Position of Attention (at Port Arms), and face to the half left. From this position,\\nthe firing party is commanded to Present Arms before the playing of \u201cTaps.\u201d After \u201cTaps,\u201d\\nthey are commanded to Order Arms. The NCOIC executes a Right (Left) Face and remains\\nat Attention until the flag has been folded and saluted by the NCOIC of the funeral detail. At\\nthis time, the firing party NCOIC executes a Right (Left) Face and commands Right (Left),\\nFACE; Port, ARMS; and Forward, MARCH. At the first halt, the rifles of the firing party\\nare cleared and inspected.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 14-21Chapter 14\\nFigure 14-10. Position of fire, ceremonial firing\\n14-22 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Chapter 15\\nColors\\nFrom the earliest times, warriors used a banner or other symbol to identify specific\\nunits and to serve as a rallying point for troops. In medieval days, the standard or\\nbanner was used to signal a general assault, which was generated by a cry of \u201cAdvance\\nyour banners.\u201d Until comparatively recent years, the flags that identified nations\\nusually were based on the personal or family heraldry of the reigning monarch or ruling\\nnobleman. As autocracies faded or disappeared, dynastic Colors were no longer\\npopular and national flags, as thought of today, came into being. These national flags,\\nsuch as the Union Jack of Great Britain, the TriColor of France, and the Stars and\\nStripes, are relatively new to history.\\nSECTION I \u2013 HISTORY\\n15-1. Flags are almost as old as civilization itself. Imperial Egypt as well as the armies of Babylon, Chaldea,\\nand Assyria followed the Colors of their kings. The Old Testament frequently mentions banners and\\nstandards. Many flags of different designs were present in parts of the American Colonies before the\\nRevolution. When the struggle for independence united the Colonies, the colonists wanted a single flag to\\nrepresent the new nation. The first flag borne by the Army as a representative of the Thirteen Colonies was\\nthe Grand Union flag. It was raised over the Continental Army at Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 2 January\\n1776. That flag had the familiar 13 stripes (red and white) of the present flag, but the blue square contained\\nthe Crosses of Saint George and Saint Andrew from the British flag.\\n15-2. The Stars and Stripes was born on 14 June 1777, two years to the day after the birth of the Army. On\\nthat date, Congress resolved that the flag of the United States be 13 stripes, alternate red and white, and that\\nthe union be 13 stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation. The arrangement of the stars on\\nthe blue field was not specified:\\n\\uf06c According to some historians, the Stars and Stripes was first raised over Fort Stanwix, New York,\\non 3 August 1777. In that Army version of the flag, the stars were arranged in a circle. (The\\nU.S. Navy version had the stars arranged to form crosses similar to the British flag.)\\n\\uf06c When Vermont and Kentucky joined the Union, the flag was modified so that there were 15 stars\\nand 15 stripes. It was that flag, flying triumphantly over Fort McHenry, Maryland, on 13 and 14\\nSeptember 1814, which inspired Francis Scott Key to compose the verses of \u201cThe Star-Spangled\\nBanner.\u201d That flag was the national banner from 1795 until 1818. Thus, when it was raised over\\nTripoli by the Marines in 1805, it was the first U.S. flag to be hoisted over conquered territory in\\nthe Old World. Later, it was flown by General Andrew Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans.\\n\\uf06c Realizing that adding a stripe for each new state would soon spoil the appearance of the flag,\\nCongress passed a law in 1818 fixing the number of stripes at 13 and providing for the addition of\\na star in the Blue Union for each new state. The star is to be added and the new flag to become\\nofficial on the Fourth of July following the admission of the new state to the Union.\\n\\uf06c It was not until shortly before the Civil War that the Stars and Stripes became the national Color.\\n15-3. Before the Civil War, in lieu of a national Color, U.S. Soldiers carried a blue silk Color on which was\\nembroidered the arms of the United States, and an American eagle bearing a shield on its breast, and in its\\ntalons an olive branch and arrows, signifying peace and war. After the national Color was authorized, the\\norganizational Color with the eagle became the regimental Color. Because of the high casualty rate among\\nthe members of the Color party, plus the advent of modern weapons, the time-honored practice of carrying\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 15-1Chapter 15\\nthe Colors in battle was discontinued. Today, the Colors, with battle streamers attached, join their unit in\\nformations during ceremonies to signify their presence during past battles.\\nSECTION II \u2013 THE COLOR AND COLORS\\n15-4. The national and organizational flags carried by Color-bearing units are called the national Color and\\nthe organizational Color. When used singularly, the term \u201cColor\u201d implies the national Color. The plural term\\n\u201cColors\u201d means the national and positional or organizational Colors. By regulation, the organizational Color\\nis not authorized a Salute; however, in the past some organizations have observed the custom of saluting the\\norganizational Color.\\n15-5. In garrison, the Colors are normally kept at the office or headquarters of the commanding officer. They\\nare escorted to and from the headquarters or office by the Color guard. In the field, the Colors are normally\\ndisplayed from reveille to retreat in front of the commanding officer\u2019s tent or command post. During\\ninclement weather, they are cased and placed in the commanding officer\u2019s office, headquarters, or tent.\\n15-6. Individuals or units passing or being passed by uncased Colors out of doors render honors. Individuals,\\nnot part of a formation, salute six steps distance from the Colors and hold the Salute until they have passed\\nsix steps beyond the Colors. The individual in charge of a formation calls the formation to ATTENTION\\nand Present, ARMS.\\n15-7. The Colors will be carried on all ceremonial occasions when two or more companies, honor guards, or\\nrepresentative elements of a command participate. Traditionally, the CSM is responsible for the safeguarding,\\ncare, and display of the organizational Color. The CSM is also responsible for the selection, training, and\\nperformance of the Color bearers and Color guards.\\n15-8. During a review, parade, or honor guard ceremony, ordinarily only one national Color is present. The\\nnational Color is given the honor position and is carried on the marching right of positional and organizational\\nColors. The U.S. Army flag or the Army field flag (when authorized) is carried to the immediate left of the\\nnational Color. The organizational Color of the senior headquarters sponsoring the ceremony is carried to the\\nleft of the Army flag or field flag, if present. The Colors belonging to the headquarters conducting the\\nceremonies are positioned on line with and centered on the command. Subordinate Color-bearing\\norganizations ordinarily carry only their organizational Colors (four steps to the rear of their staff). The\\nregulation for individual flags and distinguishing flags for general officers and other dignitaries is the same\\nas that for organizational Colors (see AR 840-10).\\n15-9. When the local commander wishes, or considers it more appropriate, they may authorize subordinate\\nColor-bearing organizations to carry their national Color with their organizational Colors behind their staffs.\\nConsideration must be given as to the number of times the spectators will be required to stand during the pass\\nin review. Also, consideration must be given to the frequency of Salutes required by the reviewing officer:\\n\\uf06c Another method in which subordinate Color-bearing units may carry their Colors is to have them\\nparticipate in a massed Colors formation. Because of many complications caused by massed\\nColors, units should prescribe a local SOP governing the desired procedures.\\n\\uf06c Examples of complications include: organizational Colors losing their identity, order of\\nprecedence, resizing of Color guards and bearers, uniformity when the first rank consists of five\\nSoldiers rather than four, and presenting a good appearance when returning to the formation after\\nbeing brought forward while keeping the national Color on the marching right.\\n15-10. When Colors are participating in a ceremony, they will be received and dismissed. Information\\npertaining to Colors participating in a ceremony are described in paragraphs 15-20 and 15-24.\\nSALUTES\\n15-11. The national Color renders no Salute (dip). An exception to this rule is followed by naval vessels\\nwhen, upon receiving a Salute of this type from a vessel registered by a nation formally recognized by the\\nUnited States, the compliment must be returned.\\n15-12. The organizational Color Salutes (dips) in all military ceremonies while the national anthem, \u201cTo\\nthe Color,\u201d or a foreign national anthem is being played, and when rendering honors to the organizational\\n15-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Colors\\ncommander or an individual of higher grade including foreign dignitaries of higher grade, but in no other\\ncase. The U.S. Army flag is considered to be an organizational Color and, as such, is also dipped while the\\nnational anthem, \u201cTo the Color,\u201d or a foreign national anthem is being played, and when rendering honors to\\nthe Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, their direct representative, or an individual of equivalent or higher grade,\\nbut in no other case:\\n\\uf06c When marching, organizational Colors salute when six steps from the person entitled to the Salute.\\n\\uf06c They are returned to the Carry position when six steps beyond the person.\\nCOLOR GUARD\\n15-13. The Color guard consists of two (three) sergeants and two specialists or privates. It is an honor to be\\nselected as a member of the Color guard. The senior (Color) sergeant carries the national Color and\\ncommands the Color guard. The senior (Color) sergeant gives the necessary commands for the movements\\nand for rendering honors. The uniform for Color guards should be the same as prescribed for participating\\ntroops. In addition to the uniform, the Color guard should be provided white polyester dress gloves, uniform\\nneck scarves, and a white, black, or olive drab flag carrier. The flag carrier could be a single or double leather\\nor web strapped harness with a brass or chrome cup.\\n15-14. When battalions or brigades carry their organizational Colors in a ceremony as part of a larger\\ncommand, the battalion or brigade Color is carried four steps to the rear of the staff. A sergeant acts as Color\\nbearer and two experienced specialists or privates, selected by the battalion or brigade CSM, act as members\\nof the Color guard.\\n15-15. The Color guard is formed and Marched in one rank at Close Interval, the bearers in the center. They\\ndo not execute Rear March or About Face. The Color guard marches at Right Shoulder Arms and executes\\nFacing movements by wheeling to the right or left. The command for a Facing movement is Right (Left)\\nWheel, MARCH. To execute a Wheeling movement, the guard nearest the direction of turn serves as the\\npivot point and executes the movement by marching in place and simultaneously turning in the new direction.\\nOther members shorten their steps and turn in an arc keeping abreast of each other to maintain alignment.\\nWhen the movement has been completed, each member automatically marches in place until the command\\nHALT or Forward, MARCH is given.\\n15-16. When passing in review, the Color guard executes Eyes Right at the prescribed saluting distance on\\nthe command of the Color sergeant. The commands are Eyes, RIGHT and Ready, FRONT. The\\norganizational Color salutes at the command RIGHT and resumes the Carry at the command FRONT. The\\nguard on the right flank of the Color guard does not execute Eyes Right.\\n15-17. During ceremonies, the Color guard remains at Right Shoulder Arms except when executing Present\\nArms. When not participating in a ceremony and a situation occurs that warrants a Salute by the\\norganizational Color, the Color sergeant commands Color, SALUTE. The return to the Carry is made at the\\ncommand Carry, COLOR.\\n15-18. When in formation with the Color company, and not during a ceremony, the Color bearers execute\\nAt Ease and Rest, keeping the staffs of the Colors vertical. The Color guard executes Right Shoulder Arms,\\nOrder Arms, and Present Arms with the Color company. During ceremonies when the Colors are not forward\\nand remarks are to be made, the Color guards and Color bearers execute Order Arms and Parade Rest on\\ncommand of the Color company commander. During any ceremony when the units are At Ease, the Color\\nguard and Color bearers are at Parade Rest.\\nRECEIVING OR DISMISSING THE COLORS BY THE COLOR\\nGUARD\\n15-19. The Color guard uses the following procedures when receiving or dismissing the Colors:\\n\\uf06c When receiving uncased Colors on display in the commander\u2019s office, the Color guard is\\npositioned in a single rank facing the Colors. The Color sergeant commands Present, ARMS and\\nOrder, ARMS. On completion of Order Arms, the Color bearers (without command) secure the\\nColors. The Color guard files outside (guard, national Color, organizational Color, guard) and\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 15-3Chapter 15\\nre-forms in a line formation. The Color guards execute Right Shoulder Arms and the Color bearers\\nassume the Carry Position.\\n\\uf06c To dismiss the Colors, the procedures are basically the same except that the Colors are placed\\nback in their stands before executing Present Arms.\\nCASING AND UPCASING THE COLORS\\n15-20. To case and uncase the Colors, the Color guard forms in a line formation with the cased Colors at\\nthe Carry Position (Order Position when indoors). The CSM (or their direct representative) positions\\nthemselves six steps in front of and centered on the formation. They then command Sling, ARMS:\\n\\uf06c The Color guards immediately adjust their slings and assume Sling Arms. The CSM commands\\nPOST. The Color guards face to the Half Left (Right) in marching, take four steps, halt, and\\nexecute About Face.\\n\\uf06c The CSM then directs UNCASE THE COLORS. The Color bearers lower the Colors (same as\\nPresent Guidon). The two guards move forward and untie and uncase the Colors. The Color\\nbearers unfurl and immediately return the Colors to the Carry (Order) Position. While the Colors\\nare being unfurled, the guards fold the cases and secure them in their left hand.\\n\\uf06c When the Colors are in the Carry Position, the CSM commands Present, ARMS. The CSM, Color\\nguards, and the organizational Color Salute.\\n\\uf06c The CSM commands Order, ARMS, and then commands POST. On the command of execution\\nPOST, the Color guards place the folded canvas cases inside the cartridge belts (center rear) of\\nthe Color bearers. The Color guards assume their original positions, adjust their slings, and return\\nto Right Shoulder Arms.\\n\\uf06c If the CSM or their representative is not present, the senior Color sergeant gives the necessary\\ncommands.\\nNote. To case the Colors, the procedures are basically the same except Present Arms is given\\nbefore the Colors are lowered.\\n15-21. When casing or uncasing the Colors with the command present, the commander directs UNCASE\\n(CASE) THE COLORS. The CSM and Color guards execute the movement (as previously stated in\\nparagraph 15-20) except that they execute Present Arms and Order Arms with the Color company. When the\\nColors are uncased and returned to the Carry Position, the commander directs BRING YOUR UNITS TO\\nPRESENT ARMS. After the units have executed this directive, the commander then directs BRING YOUR\\nUNITS TO ORDER ARMS.\\n15-22. If the Colors are to be cased or uncased during the receiving or dismissing by the Color company,\\nthe Color guards execute Present Arms and Order Arms on command of the company commander. The CSM\\nuncases the organizational Color when it is displayed by itself. The CSM major may also assist the Color\\nguards when uncasing more than two Colors.\\nRECEIVING OR DISMISSING THE COLORS BY COLOR COMPANY\\n15-23. The designated Color company receives and dismisses the Colors as follows:\\n\\uf06c The Color company should receive the Colors before it forms with the battalion.\\n\\uf06c The Color company forms at Attention with the commander facing to the front as the Colors near\\nthe Color company.\\n\\uf06c The Color guard, guided by the senior sergeant, approaches from the front and halts 10 steps from\\nthe company commander.\\n\\uf06c The company commander then faces about and commands Present, ARMS, faces the Colors, and\\nSalutes. They terminate their Salute, faces about, and commands Order, ARMS.\\n\\uf06c The specialists or privates of the Color guard execute Present Arms and return to Right Shoulder\\nArms on the commands of the company commander (Present Arms and Order Arms).\\n15-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Colors\\n\\uf06c The senior sergeant then marches the Color guard to its position within the company formation. If\\nthe company is in column formation, the Color guard forms at the rear of the company. When the\\ncompany is in line or mass formation, the Color guard forms at the left of the company. The Color\\ncompany may join the battalion before the battalion forms at the ceremony site or join with the\\nbattalion at the ceremony site. When the Color company joins the battalion, the senior Color\\nsergeant marches the Color guard to its appropriate post in the battalion formation.\\n\\uf06c The Color guard is dismissed at the conclusion of the ceremony. This can occur in the vicinity of\\nthe ceremony site, in the Color company area, or at the battalion headquarters. At the designated\\narea, the senior sergeant marches and halts the Color guard 10 steps in front of and facing the\\ncommander of the Color company. The actions for dismissing the Colors are the same as receiving\\nthe Colors. After being dismissed, the Color guard marches to the office, headquarters, or tent of\\nthe commanding officer.\\n\\uf06c The Colors are received and dismissed from organizations smaller than a company, such as a\\nfuneral escort, in a similar manner.\\n\\uf06c Casing and uncasing the Colors may be scheduled in conjunction with receiving and dismissing\\nthe Colors.\\nPOSTING AND RETIRING THE COLORS\\n15-24. Formal assemblies conducted indoors begin with the presentation of the Colors, referred to as\\nposting the Colors, and end with the retirement of the Colors. The following instructions outline the\\nprocedures for posting and retiring the Colors, with a head table and without head table. Since indoor areas\\nvary in size, configuration, and intended purpose, these instructions do not apply to all situations. Therefore,\\npersons planning an indoor ceremony can modify these instructions based on their specific floor plan. Color\\nbearers must conduct a reconnaissance of the ceremony location taking note of the dimensions of the room.\\nLow ceilings will present significant challenges when trying to raise and lower Colors.\\nPOSTING THE COLORS\\n15-25. The Color guard forms outside the entrance to the dining area, auditorium, or meeting hall. The\\naudience is directed to stand until the Colors are posted. If the playing of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d (or\\nother appropriate music) and the invocation are scheduled, the audience will remain standing until they are\\ncompleted:\\n\\uf06c When the arrangements include a head table, the Color guard enters in a line formation, preferably,\\nor forms in a line immediately inside the room and moves to a position centered on and facing the\\nhead table:\\n\\uf0a7 When the Colors arrive at the predesignated position, the Color sergeant commands Colors,\\nHALT, and Present, ARMS; and reports \u201cThe Colors are present.\u201d The host acknowledges\\nthe report and directs POST THE COLORS. The area should be arranged to allow adequate\\nspace for the Color guard to move between the head table and the flag stand.\\n\\uf0a7 The Color sergeant then commands Order, ARMS; Right, FACE; and Forward, MARCH.\\nOn the command of execution MARCH, the Color guard marches to the rear of the head table\\n(see figure 15-1 on page 15-7).\\n\\uf0a7 Once the Color guard is centered on the flag stand, they Mark Time and the Color sergeant\\ncommands Colors, HALT and Right, FACE. The Color guard should approach the flag\\nstands from the right to position the national Color bearer in front of the flag holder on the\\nright, facing the audience.\\n\\uf0a7 The Color bearers, without command, place the Colors in the stand.\\n\\uf0a7 When the Colors are in the stand, the Color sergeant commands Present, ARMS and Order,\\nARMS. The guards return to Right Shoulder Arms; the Color sergeant commands Left, FACE\\nand Forward, MARCH; and the Color guard exits the area.\\n\\uf06c When a head table is not used, the Color guard enters and moves to a predesignated position\\ncentered on and facing the audience.

At the Order, rest the ferrule of the staff on the marching surface touching the outside of the right\\nfootgear opposite the ball of the right foot. Hold the staff in the right hand with the back of the hand facing\\noutward and the fingers wrapped around the staff. Rest the staff against the hollow of the shoulder (see\\nfigure 15-6).\\nFigure 15-6. Position of the Colors at the Order\\nPOSITION OF THE COLORS AT THE CARRY\\n15-34. At the Carry, rest the ferrule of the staff in the socket of the sling. The socket is below the waist and\\nadjusted to ensure that the finials of all Colors are of equal height (see figure 15-7). Grasp the staff with the\\nright hand (even with the mouth) and incline it slightly to the front with the left hand securing the ferrule in\\nthe socket. The left hand may be positioned immediately below the right hand to more firmly secure the\\nColors on windy days.\\n15-14 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Colors\\nFigure 15-7.

In the 19th century,\\nbranches of service were lined up from right to left: Infantry, field artillery, and\\nCavalry, respectively. Field artillery lined up their guns but did not fire them. When\\nhonors began to be fired in ceremonies, the guns were moved out of the formation to\\navoid injury to other elements of the formation.\\nSECTION I \u2013 PREPARATION\\n16-1. The salute battery should arrive at the ceremonial site early enough to position its pieces before the\\narrival of units on the ready line:\\n\\uf06c The pieces are positioned downwind from the ceremony site with the muzzles pointing away from\\nthe reviewing stand. When possible, the opened trails are two steps to the rear of the final line and\\nthe number six piece is positioned twelve steps from the left flank unit. Other pieces are positioned\\nabout four steps apart (measure from inside wheels) and on line with number six.\\n\\uf06c Once the pieces are in position, the battery is formed to the left of the number one piece and in\\nfront of the line so that the number six and three sections are on the final line (see figure 16-1).\\nFigure 16-1. Position of salute battery and personnel before the review\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 16-1Chapter 16\\nSECTION II \u2013 SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AND INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS\\n16-2. The sequence of events and individual actions necessary to conduct a salute battery are described\\nherein. The COT should verify that the salute battery and band are prepared to render honors.\\nFORMATION OF TROOPS\\n16-3. On hearing the band sound Attention, the battery commander Faces About, commands Battery,\\nATTENTION, and again faces about:\\n\\uf06c On completion of the adjutant\u2019s call, the battery commander Faces About and commands Right,\\nFACE. They then command Section, POST.\\n\\uf06c The section chiefs in reverse sequence (for example, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) command Forward, MARCH\\nor Column Half Right, MARCH. The sections march forward along the final line and halt when\\ncentered on the piece.\\n\\uf06c The battery commander faces to the left and commands (themselves and their staff) Column Half\\nRight, MARCH. They march forward (inclining as necessary) so that when halted the battery\\ncommander is six steps from and centered on the firing battery. The section chief and the counter\\nshould be centered and three steps to the rear of the commander. The executive officer is on line\\nwith the guidon bearer.\\n\\uf06c When the battery commander has halted their staff, they face to the right and command Left,\\nFACE. Then they command Dress right, DRESS; Ready, FRONT; and Parade, REST (for large\\nreviews, the command AT EASE may be substituted for Parade, REST). The commander then\\nfaces about and executes Parade Rest.\\nPRESENTATION OF HONORS\\n16-4. When the COT has directed Order Arms (adjutant has taken their post), the battery commander faces\\nabout and commands Order, ARMS. They then direct FIRE THE SALUTE and faces about:\\n\\uf06c The battery commander quietly commands (themselves and their guidon bearer) Present, ARMS\\nand Order, ARMS, as appropriate.\\n\\uf06c The executive officer, counter, and chief of the firing battery face about. The executive officer\\ncommands Cannoneers, POST. The cannoneers immediately move to their firing positions.\\n\\uf06c The executive officer commands With blank ammunition (pause), LOAD. They then command\\nSTAND BY, NUMBER ONE. As each piece is ready to fire, the section chief raises their arm\\n(nearest the executive officer) and looks at the executive officer.\\n\\uf06c When all section chiefs have indicated they are ready (arm raised), the executive officer raises\\ntheir right arm and looks at the COT. The COT takes the raised arm as the signal that the battery\\nis ready to fire. They then face about and command (themselves and their staff) Present, ARMS.\\n\\uf06c As the commander\u2019s hand touches their headgear, the executive officer signals the first piece to\\nfire. The executive officer drops their arm to a horizontal position and then raises it back to a\\nvertical position for each round. Rounds are fired at 3-second intervals for normal honors and\\n5-second intervals for funerals (see AR 600-25).\\n\\uf06c During the Salute, as the second to last round is fired, the counter faces about and announces\\nELEVEN. As the next to last round is fired, the chief of the firing battery Faces About and\\nannounces TWELVE. This is the signal for the executive officer to fire one more round.\\n\\uf06c During the firing, each section immediately reloads after each round is fired and is prepared to fire\\nin case of a misfire. When the last round has been fired, the executive officer signals CEASE\\nFIRE and then signals UNLOAD.\\n\\uf06c When all pieces are unloaded and the cannoneers are at Attention, the executive officer commands\\nto the rear of the piece, FALL IN (cannoneers automatically fall in at Dress Right); they then\\ncommand Ready, FRONT and Parade, REST. When all sections are back in position on the final\\nline, the executive officer faces about.\\n16-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Salute Battery\\nINSPECTION\\n16-5. As the reviewing party approaches piece number six, the battery commander faces about and\\ncommands Battery, ATTENTION. They then face to the front and (over their right shoulder) command\\nEyes, RIGHT:\\n\\uf06c The battery commander and executive officer execute Eyes Right and Salute. The guidon bearer\\nexecutes Eyes Right and Present Guidon. All others execute Eyes Right and follow the reviewing\\nofficer, turning the head until facing to the front.\\n\\uf06c When the reviewing party has passed the last piece, the battery commander commands Order,\\nARMS for themselves, the executive officer, and the guidon bearer. They then face about. When\\nthe reviewing party has cleared the right rear of their unit, they then command Parade, REST,\\nfaces about, and assumes Parade Rest.\\nHONORS TO THE NATION AND REMARKS\\n16-6. The battery executes appropriate movements on command or directives by the COT. The COT always\\nverifies the battery is prepared for each movement.\\nMARCH IN REVIEW\\n16-7. On the command or directive to PASS IN REVIEW, the battery commander faces about and\\ncommands Parade, REST. They then face about and assume Parade Rest.\\nCONCLUSION\\n16-8. When the band begins the eight-bar drum beat (before \u201cThe Army Goes Rolling Along\u201d), the battery\\ncommander faces about and commands Battery, ATTENTION. They then face about. When the band has\\nfinished playing the music, the battery commander faces about and commands REST.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 16-3This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 17\\nCivilian Participation in Military Ceremonies\\nThis chapter serves as a guide for commanders in planning and conducting military\\nceremonies with civilian participation.\\nSECTION I \u2013 HISTORY\\n17-1. Since its inception at the beginning of the American Revolution, the U.S. Army has always seen the\\nimportance of civilian control of the military and participation of civilians in military activities. As a result,\\nmilitary ceremonies are frequently held to honor civilians.\\nSECTION II \u2013 TYPES OF CEREMONIES\\n17-2. Civilians may participate in three general categories of military ceremonies:\\n\\uf06c Presenting awards.\\n\\uf06c Receiving awards.\\n\\uf06c Being honored.\\nCIVILIANS PRESENTING AWARDS\\n17-3. This category includes occasions when an award is made to another civilian and occasions when\\nawards are presented to military personnel by a civilian. These ceremonies are conducted as previously\\noutlined with the following exceptions:\\n\\uf06c The host or reviewing officer is accompanied to the reviewing stand by the civilian. The reviewing\\nofficer may relinquish the place of honor to the civilian.\\n\\uf06c The reviewing officer accompanies the civilian throughout the sequence of events.\\n\\uf06c Because of lack of familiarity with military ceremonies, it may be necessary to brief the civilian\\nbefore and during the conduct of the ceremony.\\nCIVILIANS RECEIVING AWARDS\\n17-4. Conduct of these ceremonies should be guided by paragraph 10-25 with the following exceptions:\\n\\uf06c Civilians should be initially positioned to the left of the reviewing stand and not marched forward\\nwith the military personnel, if any, to receive awards.\\n\\uf06c When the Colors are brought forward, civilians move to a position five steps in front of and\\ncentered on the Colors. When military and civilians receive an award at the same time, they are\\naligned from right to left with the highest award on the right.\\n\\uf06c When the awardees are posted, they remain in the same order. If there are no military awardees,\\nthe civilians move to the left of the reviewing stand.\\n\\uf06c When this ceremony is conducted for presenting posthumous awards, other types of awards are\\nnot incorporated. A carefully selected escort officer should accompany relatives of persons\\nreceiving posthumous awards.\\nNote. If there is only one awardee, they may be the reviewing official.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 17-1Chapter 17\\nREVIEWS IN HONOR OF CIVILIANS\\n17-5. Government employees, private citizens; and local, state, national, or foreign officials may be honored\\nby a review. (See AR 600-25 for special honors due for certain officials.) Other civilians may be honored, as\\nnoted in paragraphs 17-3 and 17-4, by participating in the place of or with the reviewing officer.\\n17-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Appendix A\\nSaluting\\nThe origin of the Hand Salute is uncertain. Some historians believe it began in late\\nRoman times when assassinations were common. A citizen who wanted to see a public\\nofficial had to approach with their right hand raised to show that they did not hold a\\nweapon. Knights in armor raised visors with the right hand when meeting a comrade.\\nThis practice gradually became a way of showing respect and, in early American\\nhistory, sometimes involved removing the hat. By 1820, the motion was modified to\\ntouching the hat, and since then it has become the Hand Salute used today.\\nWHEN TO SALUTE\\nA-1. Army personnel in uniform are required to salute when they meet and recognize persons entitled (by\\ngrade) to a salute except when it is inappropriate or impractical (in public conveyances such as planes and\\nbuses, in public places such as inside theaters, or when driving a vehicle):\\n\\uf06c Salutes are also rendered\u2014\\n\\uf0a7 When the U.S. national anthem, \u201cTo the Color,\u201d \u201cHail to the Chief,\u201d or foreign national\\nanthems are played.\\n\\uf0a7 To uncased national Color outdoors.\\n\\uf0a7 On ceremonial occasions as prescribed in Part Two, Ceremonies.\\n\\uf0a7 At reveille and retreat ceremonies, during the raising or lowering of the flag.\\n\\uf0a7 During the sounding of honors.\\n\\uf0a7 When the Pledge of Allegiance to the U.S. flag is being recited outdoors.\\n\\uf0a7 When turning over control of formations.\\n\\uf0a7 When rendering reports.\\n\\uf0a7 To officers of friendly foreign countries.\\n\\uf06c Salutes are not required when\u2014\\n\\uf0a7 Indoors, except when reporting to an officer or when on duty as a guard.\\n\\uf0a7 Addressing a prisoner.\\n\\uf0a7 Saluting is obviously inappropriate. In these cases, only greetings are exchanged. (Example:\\nA person carrying articles with both hands, or otherwise occupied so that saluting is\\nimpracticable, is not required to salute a senior person or return the salute to a subordinate.)\\n\\uf0a7 Either the senior or the subordinate is wearing civilian clothes.\\n\\uf06c In any case not covered by specific instructions, the salute is rendered.\\nREPORTING INDOORS\\nA-2. When reporting to an officer in their office, the Soldier removes their headgear, knocks, and enters\\nwhen told to do so. They approach within two steps of the officer\u2019s desk, Halts, Salutes, and Reports, \u201cSir\\n(Ma\u2019am), Private Smit reports.\u201d The salute is held until the report is completed and the salute has been\\nreturned by the officer. When the business is completed, the Soldier salutes, holds the salute until it has been\\nreturned, executes the appropriate facing movement, and departs. When reporting indoors under arms, the\\nprocedure is the same except that the headgear is not removed and the Soldier renders the salute prescribed\\nfor the weapon with which they are armed.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 A-1Appendix A\\nNotes. 1. The expression \u201cunder arms\u201d means carrying a weapon in your hands, by a sling, or in a\\nholster.\\n2.When reporting to a NCO, the procedures are the same, except no salutes are exchanged.\\nREPORTING OUTDOORS\\nA-3. When reporting outdoors, the Soldier moves rapidly toward the officer, and halts approximately three\\nsteps from the officer, Salutes, and Reports (as when indoors). When the Soldier is dismissed by the officer,\\nsalutes are again exchanged. If under arms, the Soldier carries the weapon in the manner prescribed for\\nsaluting.\\nSALUTING PERSONS IN VEHICLES\\nA-4. The practice of saluting officers in official vehicles (recognized individually by grade or identifying\\nvehicle plates and or flags) is considered an appropriate courtesy. Salutes are not required to be rendered by\\nor to personnel who are driving or riding in privately owned vehicles except by gate guards, who render\\nsalutes to recognized officers in all vehicles unless their duties make the salute impractical. When military\\npersonnel are drivers of a moving vehicle, they do not initiate a salute (see AR 600-25).\\nOTHER SALUTES\\nA-5. Other instances when saluting may or may not be required\u2014when in formation, not in formation,\\noutdoors, and indoors. Each have different requirements in regards to salutes and are discussed herein.\\nIN FORMATION\\nA-6. Individuals in formation do not salute or return salutes except at the command Present, ARMS. The\\nindividual in charge salutes and acknowledges salutes for the entire formation. Commanders of organizations\\nor detachments that are not a part of a larger formation salute officers of higher grade by bringing the\\norganization or detachment to attention before saluting. When in the field under battle or simulated battle\\nconditions, the organization or detachment is not brought to attention. An individual in formation at ease or\\nat rest comes to attention when addressed by an officer.\\nNOT IN FORMATION\\nA-7. On the approach of an officer, a group of individuals not in formation is called to Attention by the first\\nperson noticing the officer, and all come sharply to Attention and salute. This action is to be taken at\\napproximately six paces away from the officer, or the closest point of approach. Individuals participating in\\ngames, and members of work details, do not salute. The individual in charge of a work detail, if not actively\\nengaged, salutes and acknowledges Salutes for the entire detail. A unit resting alongside a road does not come\\nto Attention upon the approach of an officer; however, if the officer addresses an individual (or group), the\\nindividual (or group) comes to Attention and remains at Attention (unless otherwise ordered) until the\\ntermination of the conversation, at which time the individual (or group) Salutes the officer.\\nOUTDOORS\\nA-8. Whenever and wherever the U.S. national anthem, \u201cTo the Color,\u201d \u201cReveille,\u201d or \u201cHail to the Chief\u201d\\nis played, at the first note, all dismounted personnel in uniform and not in formation face the flag (or the\\nmusic, if the flag is not in view), stand at Attention, and render the prescribed Salute. The position of Salute\\nis held until the last note of the music is sounded. Military personnel not in uniform will stand at Attention\\n(remove headdress, if any, with the right hand), and place the right hand over the heart. Vehicles in motion\\nare brought to a Halt. Persons riding in a passenger car or on a motorcycle dismount and salute. Occupants\\nof other types of military vehicles and buses remain in the vehicle and sit at attention; the individual in charge\\nA-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Saluting\\nof each vehicle dismounts and renders the Hand Salute. Tank and armored car commanders Salute from the\\nvehicle.\\nINDOORS\\nA-9. When the national anthem is played indoors, officers and enlisted personnel stand at Attention and face\\nthe music, or the flag if one is present. There is no saluting indoors except when reporting to a commander\\nand when on duty as a guard as previously mentioned at the beginning of this appendix.\\nNote. Narrators or printed programs can help inform spectators of appropriate responses.\\nSALUTING COLORS\\nA-10. National and organizational flags, which are mounted on flagstaffs equipped with finials, are called\\nColors. Military personnel passing an uncased national Color salute at six steps distance and hold the Salute\\nuntil they have passed six steps beyond it. Similarly, when the uncased Color passes by, they Salute when it\\nis six steps away and hold the Salute until it has passed six steps beyond them.\\nNote. Small flags carried by individuals, such as those carried by civilian spectators at a parade,\\nare not saluted. It is improper to salute with any object in the right hand or with a cigarette, cigar,\\nor pipe in the mouth.\\nUNCOVERING\\nA-11. Officers and enlisted Soldiers under arms uncover only when\u2014\\n\\uf06c Seated as a member of (or in attendance on) a court or board.\\n\\uf06c Entering places of divine worship.\\n\\uf06c In attendance at an official reception.\\nA-12. Personnel remove their headdress indoors. When outdoors, military headdress is never removed, or\\nraised as a form of salutation. When appropriate, civilians may be saluted in lieu of removing the headdress.\\nSALUTING UPON BOARDING NAVAL SHIPS\\nA-13. When Army personnel board U.S. Navy ships, either as an individual or as a unit leader, they salute\\naccording to naval procedures:\\n\\uf06c When boarding a naval ship, upon reaching the top of the gangway, face and salute the national\\nensign. After completing this salute, salute the officer of the deck who will be standing on the\\nquarter deck at the head of the gangway. When saluting the officer of the deck, request permission\\nto board, \u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, request permission to come aboard.\u201d The officer of the deck will return\\nthe salute.\\n\\uf06c When leaving the ship, render the same salutes in reverse order, and request permission to leave,\\n\u201cSir or Ma\u2019am, request permission to go ashore.\u201d\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 A-3This page intentionally left blank.Appendix B\\nManual of Arms\u2014M16-Series Rifle\\nThe manual of arms movements for the M16-series rifle (see figure B-1) are nearly the\\nsame as those for the M4-series carbine.

It\\nalso shows the sequence of events for a change of command and change of\\nresponsibility ceremonies.\\nG-1. Ceremonies honor lineage and history, thereby requiring the utmost in respect and courtesy. Military\\nceremonies can honor high-ranking commanders, officials, or dignitaries; or permit them to observe the state\\nof training of an organization. Military ceremonies can also be used to present decorations and awards, honor\\nor recognize unit or individual achievements, commemorate events, mark changes of command and\\nresponsibility, and induct newly promoted NCOs into the ranks. Presentation of awards recognizes\\ndistinguished accomplishment by the Service member. AR 600-8-22 states that awards will be presented with\\nan appropriate air of formality and with fitting ceremony.\\nG-2. There are several different types of ceremonies that units will occasionally conduct. Unit CSMs and\\ntheir staff will develop their own sequence of events for the following types of ceremonies:\\n\\uf06c Change of command.\\n\\uf06c Change of responsibility.\\n\\uf06c NCO induction.\\n\\uf06c Assumption of responsibility.\\n\\uf06c Relinquishment of responsibility.\\n\\uf06c Award.\\n\\uf06c Deployment and redeployment.\\n\\uf06c Hail and farewell.\\n\\uf06c Army school graduation (special units).\\n\\uf06c Award of Expert Infantry Badge or Expert Field Medical Badge.\\n\\uf06c Wreath laying.\\n\\uf06c Special events.\\n\\uf06c Spurs awarding (Cavalry specific).\\nG-3. Most ceremonies will include some of the mandatory events listed in the reviews chapter and end with\\nthe playing of the Army song. A unit CSM or their designated representative develops their ceremony specific\\nSOP and ensure the preparedness of the unit conducting the ceremony. If the ceremony is conducted at the\\ncompany or troop level, then the responsibilities for the sequence of events could be delegated to the company\\nfirst sergeant and command team. Hail and farewells do not require the playing of the national anthem or\\nplaying of the Army song. Figure G-1 on page G-2 shows a sample checklist for conducting military\\nceremonies.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 G-1Appendix G\\nFigure G-1.

When the adjutant announces\\n\u201cAttention to Orders\u201d everyone present at the ceremony silence all conversations and focus on the\\npresentation of the award. If the commander requires military members present at the ceremony to be at the\\nposition of Attention, then execution command ATTENTION is given prior to the presentation of the award.\\nPlease see the example below.\\nExample:\\nFormal setting: During a squadron award ceremony the unit is in a squadron formation.\\nThe squadron commander calls all awardees to post. The awardees march to a\\ndesignated spot in front of the formation and are prepared to receive their awards. The\\nsquadron commander announces Squadron, ATTENTION. They then direct the\\nadjutant to publish the orders. The adjutant reads off all Soldier\u2019s awards to the entire\\nformation while the squadron commander and CSM present the awards to the\\nawardees.\\nInformal setting: During a troop hail and farewell ceremony at a local establishment or\\nbanquet hall, the troop commander presents a few permanent change of station\\nawards to deserving Soldiers. The troop commander would ask the awardees to move\\nto the front of the crowd to receive their award. The troop commander, at their\\ndiscretion, would then direct their executive officer or troop representative to publish\\nthe orders. The adjutant would announce \u201cAttention to Orders.\u201d All personnel in\\nattendance of the ceremony would silence all conversations and direct all their\\nattention to the presentation of the award.\\nG-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Appendix H\\nMounted Drill\\nThis appendix contains the procedures for the orderly formation and movement of\\nvehicles during drill and ceremonies for motorized and mechanized units. When\\nnecessary, the procedures may be modified to conform to local conditions.\\nGENERAL\\nH-1. Motorized and mechanized units, when dismounted, conduct drill and ceremonies in the same manner\\nas prescribed for Infantry units. The COT has the same responsibilities as well.\\nH-2. When mounted in vehicles, visible troops sit at Attention. Those armed with a rifle place the butt of\\nthe weapon alongside the right foot in the same manner as Order Arms, with the weapon vertical and parallel\\nto the calf of the leg. Grasp the weapon with the right hand so that the right forearm is horizontal. Visible\\ntroops not armed with a rifle, fold their arms (right over the left) and raise the elbows so that the upper arms\\nare horizontal.\\nH-3. When marching units and motorized and/or mechanized units take part in the same ceremony, the units\\nform dismounted (in a formation corresponding to the marching units) with their vehicles to the rear. On the\\ndirective PASS IN REVIEW, the commander faces about and directs at your vehicles, FALL IN or\\nMOUNT (LOAD) YOUR VEHICLES. Subordinate commanders and leaders, in sequence from right to\\nleft, command At your vehicles, FALL IN (MOUNT YOUR VEHICLES) and all vehicle members\\ndouble-time to their vehicle. On the signal to mount, they mount their vehicle. Drivers observe their\\ncommander or leader for the signal to start engines.\\nFORMATIONS\\nH-4. The formations for motorized and mechanized units are basically the same as for Infantry units. The\\ninterval between vehicles is about five steps. The distance is about 10 steps between vehicles one behind the\\nother. Mass formations may be used for ceremonies or instruction by companies or larger units:\\n\\uf06c Column. In this formation, the vehicles are placed one behind the other, and the right edges of the\\nvehicles are aligned.\\n\\uf06c Line. In this formation, vehicles are abreast, and the front edges of the vehicles are aligned.\\n\\uf06c Mass. A unit formed with two or more columns abreast constitutes a mass. Masses may be grouped\\nas follows:\\n\\uf0a7 Line of masses. Masses abreast with 10-step intervals (see figure H-1 on page H-2).\\n\\uf0a7 Column of masses. Masses placed one behind another with 10-step intervals between\\ncompanies (see figure H-2 on page H-3).\\n\\uf0a7 Line of battalions in line of masses. Battalions in line of masses abreast with 20-step intervals\\nbetween battalions.\\n\\uf0a7 Line of battalions in column of masses. Battalions in column of masses abreast with 20-step\\nintervals between battalions.\\n\\uf0a7 Column of battalions in line of masses. Battalions in line of masses, placed one behind\\nanother, with 20-step intervals between battalions.\\n\\uf0a7 Column of battalions in columns of masses. Battalions in column of masses, placed one\\nbehind another, with 20-step intervals between battalions.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 H-1Appendix H\\nFigure H-1. Armor battalions, line of mass with vehicles in mass formation\\nH-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Mounted Drill\\nFigure H-2. Column of masses\\nFORMATION AT VEHICLES\\nH-5. Personnel form at the vehicles before mounting using the following procedures:\\n\\uf06c To form at the vehicles from any formation, the command is At your vehicles, FALL IN. At the\\ncommand FALL IN, the Soldiers move (double-time) to their assigned vehicles and form as\\nshown in figure H-3 on page H-4. When there are more than five Soldiers, they form two or three\\nranks with normal distance. When there are more than 15 Soldiers, the number of Soldiers per\\nrank may be increased. (Artillery sections form as prescribed in service-of-the-piece manuals.)\\n\\uf06c To load, the command is Load, VEHICLES. On the command of execution VEHICLES, each\\nSoldier double-times and forms at their vehicle (as previously described).\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 H-3Appendix H\\nFigure H-3. Formation at the vehicle\\nMOVEMENT OF VEHICLES\\nH-6. Execute the following actions to move vehicles:\\n\\uf06c To move forward, the commander gives the warning signal FORWARD, and their vehicle moves\\nout. The other vehicles move forward at the designated distance. They are aligned on the base\\nvehicle (right).\\n\\uf06c To halt, the commander signals HALT. The driver then slows down and halts the commander\u2019s\\nvehicle. The other vehicles close to the prescribed distance and halt.\\n\\uf06c To change the direction of travel of mass formation, the commander gives the appropriate signal.\\nOn the commander\u2019s signal, the base vehicle turns 90 degrees and slows. Other vehicles turn about\\n45 degrees and continue traveling in an arc at normal speed until on line with the base vehicle. As\\nthe vehicles form on line, the base vehicle accelerates as necessary to maintain correct distance on\\nthe commander.\\nH-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Mounted Drill\\n\\uf06c To change a line formation to a column formation, the commander signals for a column. The base\\nvehicle, and those directly behind it, move forward. Other vehicles move at a 45-degree angle until\\nin line with the lead vehicle and then execute a 45-degree turn.\\n\\uf06c To change a column formation to a line formation, the commander signals a line formation. The\\nbase (right flank vehicle) stops and all other vehicles turn at a 45-degree angle, turn again at a\\n45-degree angle when the prescribed interval is obtained, and then halt when on line with the base\\nvehicle.\\nMOUNTED REVIEWS\\nH-7. Motorized and mechanized units conduct ceremonies as close as possible to the procedures prescribed\\nfor other units. They may participate (exactly as prescribed for marching units) as a dismounted unit, and on\\nthe directive PASS IN REVIEW, mount their vehicles and pass in review mounted. When desired, motorized\\nand mechanized units may position their vehicles in a prescribed formation and remain mounted throughout\\nthe ceremony.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 H-5This page intentionally left blank.Appendix I\\nFlags and Colors\\nNormally, a flag detail consists of one NCOIC, two halyard pullers, and two to eight\\nflag handlers. The purpose of the flag handlers is to ensure correct folding (unfolding)\\nof the flag and to ensure that the flag does not touch the ground. As a guide, two flag\\nhandlers are needed when raising or lowering the storm (small) flag, six handlers for\\nthe post (medium) flag, and eight handlers for the garrison (large) flag.\\nThe members of the flag detail are equipped according to local SOP and/or letter of\\ninstructions.\\nThe NCOIC inconspicuously gives the necessary commands or directives to ensure\\nproper performance by the flag detail. On windy days, the NCOIC may assist the flag\\nhandlers to secure or fold the flag. In most other situations, it is inappropriate for the\\nNCOIC to touch the flag when it is being folded or unfolded.\\nRAISING, LOWERING, AND FOLDING THE FLAG\\nI-1. Installation commanders set the time to play reveille and raise their installations flags. The flag is raised\\nat the first note of reveille. The flag is hoisted all the way to the top of the flagpole unless there are\\ncircumstances that require the U.S. flag to be flown at half mass, and those circumstances could be found in\\nAR 600-25. If the flag is flown at half-staff the flag is first hoisted all the way to the top of the pole, and then\\nbrought back down to half mass where it will remain until it is lowered.\\nI-2. Retreat is played at the time established by the installation commander, and the flag detail will lower\\nthe flag concurrent with the playing of the national anthem, or \u201cTo the Color,\u201d and after retreat. A cannon\\nsalute will go off (if available) on the final note of retreat. The flag will be lowered to ensure completion of\\nthe last note of the music. If the flag is being flown at half mast, it will be raised all the way to the top of the\\nflagpole before being lowered. The flag will be folded as discussed later in this appendix.\\nRAISING THE FLAG (REVEILLE)\\nI-3. Execute the following actions when raising the flag:\\n\\uf06c The NCOIC forms the detail in a column of twos at Double Interval between files (see figure I-1\\non page I-2). The NCOIC secures the flag from its storage area and positions themselves between\\nthe files and on line with the last two Soldiers. The NCOIC then marches the detail to the flagpole.\\n\\uf06c The detail is halted in a column, facing the flagpole on the downwind side or as appropriate. They\\nare halted so that the flagpole is centered between the halyard pullers. The NCOIC commands\\nPOST. On this command, the halyard pullers immediately move to the flagpole and ensure that\\nthe halyards are free of the pole. The flag handlers face to the center. The NCOIC then directs\\nUNFOLD THE FLAG. On this directive, the two flag handlers nearest the NCOIC begin to\\n(carefully) unfold the flag lengthwise, passing the freed end to the other handlers. When the two\\nhandlers nearest the flagpole have firmly secured the flag, the other handlers move away from the\\nflagpole (as necessary) until the flag is fully extended. The flag is not unfolded widthwise. The\\nflag handlers hold the flag waist high with their forearms horizontal to the ground.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 I-1Appendix I\\nFigure I-1. Flag detail\\n\\uf06c At the appropriate time, the NCOIC directs ATTACH THE FLAG. On this directive, all flag\\nhandlers take one side step toward the flagpole. The two handlers nearest the flagpole immediately\\nattach the top of the flag to the halyard. The halyard pullers raise the flag until the bottom of the\\nflag can be attached.\\nNote. When raising the larger flags, the NCOIC may command Ready, STEP while the halyard\\npullers raise the halyard until the lower portion of the flag is attached.\\n\\uf06c At the first note of the music, the reveille gun is fired and the halyard pullers rapidly raise the flag.\\nThe NCOIC salutes. As the flag is raised from the handlers\u2019 hands, they face the flagpole and\\nSalute. (Reveille is about 20 seconds in duration.) At the last note of the music, the NCOIC\\ncommands Order, ARMS for themselves and the flag handlers while the pullers secure the\\nhalyards. The NCOIC then positions themselves between the halyard pullers, executes an About\\nFace, and commands Ready, FACE. The detail will face in the appropriate direction to depart the\\nflagpole. They then march the detail from the site.\\nLOWERING THE FLAG (RETREAT)\\nI-4. Execute the following actions when lowering the flag:\\n\\uf06c When lowering the flag. The detail is marched and positioned at the flagpole in the same manner\\nas when raising the flag. On the command POST, the halyard pullers free the halyards, untangle\\nthem, ensure that they are free from the pole, and then temporarily resecure them; the flag handlers\\ndo not face to the center. The NCOIC then commands Parade, REST.\\n\\uf06c At the cannon shot or at the last note of \u201cRetreat\u201d (if a cannon is not fired), each halyard puller\\nimmediately frees the halyards. The NCOIC commands themselves and the flag handlers to\\nATTENTION and Present, ARMS. At the first note of \u201cTo the Color,\u201d the flag is lowered slowly\\nand with dignity.\\n\\uf06c The call, \u201cTo the Color,\u201d is approximately 40 seconds in duration. As the flag is lowered to within\\nreach, the two flag handlers farthest away from the flag terminate their Salute, move forward\\nrapidly, secure the flag, and move back from the flagpole between the columns:\\n\\uf0a7 As the flag passes each handler, they terminate their Salute and assist in securing the flag.\\nThe flag is held palms down, fingers and thumb extended and joined, forearms horizontal.\\nThe NCOIC terminates their Salute at the last note of the music.\\nI-2 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Flags and Colors\\n\\uf0a7 Once the flag is detached, it is then folded. (See figure I-2 on page I-4 for correct folding\\ntechniques.) After securing the halyard, the handlers assist in the folding.\\nNote. When taking steps forward or backward to fold the flag, the members of the detail always\\nstep off with the left foot and always bring the trail foot alongside the lead foot as in the Position\\nof Attention.\\nFOLD THE FLAG\\nI-5. Execute the following actions when folding the flag:\\n\\uf06c To fold the flag the NCOIC commands Ready, STEP. All personnel take the appropriate number\\nof steps backward to ensure that the flag is horizontal, wrinkle free, and centered on the flagpole.\\n\\uf06c The NCOIC then commands Ready, STEP. The flag handlers take the appropriate number of steps\\ntoward each other, making the first fold lengthwise. The members on the NCOIC\u2019s right ensure\\nthat their edge of the flag is overlapping the left side by about an inch, which prevents any red\\nfrom showing when the folding is complete. The NCOIC ensures that the flag is straight.\\n\\uf06c The NCOIC then commands Ready, TWO. The members of the column on the NCOIC\u2019s left\\nreach down and secure the fold with the fingers pointing upward and the palms facing away.\\n\\uf06c The NCOIC then commands Ready, THREE. The members take the appropriate number of steps\\nbackward to ensure that the flag is horizontal, wrinkle free, and centered on the flagpole.\\n\\uf06c Ready, STEP; Ready, TWO; and Ready, THREE are commanded and executed one more time\\nto get the flag completely folded lengthwise.\\n\\uf06c The flag handlers nearest the NCOIC then fold a 4-inch cuff and begin folding the flag, starting\\nwith the corner on the NCOIC\u2019s left. When folding the flag, the handlers are careful to keep the\\nedges straight and to not bend the flag.\\n\\uf06c After the flag has reached the position of honor (at the head of the right column), the NCOIC\\nmarches by the most direct route to a position directly in front of the flag handler and inspects the\\nflag. The NCOIC then receives the flag and carries it held against their chest with their forearms,\\nwith the point up.\\n\\uf06c After the flag has been folded and received by the NCOIC, they position themselves between the\\nhalyard pullers and face the storage site. The NCOIC then commands Ready, FACE. The\\nmembers of the detail make the appropriate Facing movement toward the storage site. The detail\\nis then marched to the storage site.\\nNote. Once the flag has been folded (cocked hat), it is treated as a cased Color and not saluted by\\npersons meeting the flag detail. The flag will be treated with the utmost dignity and respect but\\nnot be rendered any sort of honors.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 I-3Appendix I\\nFigure I-2. Correct method of folding U.S. flag\\nDISPLAY\\nI-6. The flag of the United States represents the living country and is considered a living thing. Rules and\\ncustoms for displaying the U.S. flag, adopted by an act of Congress in 1942 and amended in 1976, are found\\nin Title 36 of the U.S. Code.\\nNote. No other flag or pennant should be placed above or, if on the same level, to the right of the\\nflag of the United States of America, except during church services conducted by naval chaplains\\nat sea, when the church pennant may be flown above the flag and except as required by\\nmultinational agreements to which the United States is a signatory.\\nI-4 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Flags and Colors\\nI-7. The union, the field of blue with the grouping of stars representing the individual states, is the honor\\npoint and is the flag\u2019s right. When the flag is displayed, the union is always to the top and to the flag\u2019s own\\nright (the left of the observer). When carried, the flag is always free, never stretched flat or carried\\nhorizontally. In the company of other flags, the U.S. flag is always on the marching right (the flag\u2019s own\\nright) (see figure I-3), or, if there is a line of other flags, in front of the center of that line. When flags of states\\nor localities, or pennants of societies, are grouped and displayed from staffs, the U.S. flag is in the center and\\nat the highest point of the group (see figure I-3). If all flags are displayed from staffs of the same height, the\\nflag of the United States is placed in the honor position, to the right of the other flags (to the left of the\\nobserver). When flags of two or more nations are displayed, they are flown from separate staffs of the same\\nheight, they are of approximately equal size, and the U.S. flag is to the right of the others.\\nNote. When the U.S. flag is flown in conjunction with other national flags, care must be taken to\\nensure that the foreign national flag is correct and properly displayed.\\n03 May 2021 TC 3-21.5 I-5Appendix I\\nFigure I-3. National Color displayed with other flags\\nI-8. The flag of the United States is never used as drapery. It is displayed hung flat against a wall or flown\\nfree from a staff as seen in figure I-4. It is not festooned over doorways or arches, tied in a bow, or fashioned\\ninto a rosette. It is not used to cover a speaker\u2019s desk or draped over the front of a platform. For those\\npurposes, bunting may be used, giving the blue of the bunting the place of honor at the top of the arrangement\\nor in the center of the rosette. Traditionally, there is one permissible departure from the rules for display of\\nthe flag of the United States: in a dire emergency, the flag may be flown upside down as a distress signal.\\nI-6 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Flags and Colors\\nFigure I-4.

A flag, as distinguished from a Color, is not saluted except during the ceremonies of raising and\\nlowering the flag:\\n\\uf06c U.S. flags used by the Army are classified by size as follows:\\n\\uf0a7 Garrison flag. The garrison flag is 20 feet hoist by 38 feet fly of nylon wool and is displayed\\non holidays and important occasions.\\n\\uf0a7 Post flag. The post flag is 8 feet 11 3/ -inch hoist by 17 feet fly of nylon and is used for general\\n8\\ndisplay and flown daily.\\n\\uf0a7 Field flag. The field flag is 6 feet 8 inches hoist by 12 feet fly of nylon wool and is used for\\ndisplay with the positional field flag.\\n\\uf0a7 Storm flag. The storm flag is 5 feet hoist by 9 feet 6 inches fly of nylon and is flown during\\ninclement weather.\\n\\uf0a7 Interment flag. The interment flag is 5 feet hoist by 9 feet 6 inches fly of cotton bunting.\\n\\uf06c A Color is the U.S. flag trimmed on three sides with golden yellow fringe 2 1/2 inches wide. The\\nColor is primarily for indoor display. U.S. Colors used by the Army are classified by size as\\nfollows:\\n\\uf0a7 4 feet, 4 inches hoist by 5 feet, 6 inches fly displayed with the U.S. Army flag, positional\\nColors, the Corps of Cadets Colors, 1st Battalion 3rd Infantry Colors, and the chapel flag.\\n\\uf0a7 3 feet hoist by 4 feet fly displayed with the Army field flag, distinguishing flags,\\norganizational Colors, institutional flags, and the chapel flag.\\n\\uf06c Other types of military flags include\u2014\\n\\uf0a7 Colors. These are flags of organizations and certain civilian and military officials.\\n\\uf0a7 Standards. Flags of mounted units were formerly called standards.\\n\\uf0a7 Distinguished flags. These flags identify headquarters, offices, general officers, and\\norganizations, none of which is authorized organizational or individual Colors.\\n\\uf0a7 Ensign. An ensign is a rectangular flag flown from aircraft, ships, and boats.\\n\\uf0a7 Guidon. A guidon is a swallow-tailed flag carried by companies, batteries, troops, and certain\\ndetachments.\\n\\uf0a7 Pennant. A pennant is a triangular flag used for various utility purposes.\\n\\uf06c Dismounted organizations traditionally carried the Color while mounted organizations (Cavalry,\\nmechanized, and motorized) traditionally carried the standard. Colors were larger than standards.\\nUnder present regulations, both are called Colors.\\n\\uf06c The organizational Color is dipped in Salute during the playing of the U.S. national anthem, \u201cTo\\nthe Color,\u201d \u201cTaps\u201d (funerals only), and during the ceremony at reveille. It is dipped in Salute when\\nrendering honors to the organization\u2019s commander or to a person of higher grade, but at no other\\ntime. The U.S. flag is never dipped in Salute.\\n\\uf06c Until 1813, the Colors of an Infantry regiment were carried by ensigns, who were the lowest\\nranking officers of the regiment. In that year, the regulations were changed and the work was\\nentrusted to Color sergeants. NCOs carry them today.\\nARMY FLAGS\\nI-10. The U.S. Army flag is 4 feet, 4 inches hoist by 5 feet, 6 inches fly and is trimmed on three sides with\\nyellow fringe 2 \u00bd inches in width.

Brucker, Secretary of the Army. The flag, of white silk, bears an embroidered\\nreplica of the official seal of the Department of the Army in ultramarine blue (without the roman numerals).\\nA scarlet scroll inscribed \u201cUnited States Army\u201d in white is centered between the device and the ultramarine\\nblue numerals \u201c1775\u201d denoting the year the Army was founded, by action of the Continental Congress,\\n14 June 1775. The original War Office seal, constituting the central design of the flag, was authorized by the\\nContinental Congress on 8 May 1779. The U.S. Army flag bears all the streamers representing the Army\u2019s\\nI-8 TC 3-21.5 03 May 2021Flags and Colors\\ncampaigns since its inception.

FM 7-22 presents individualized\\ntraining and testing that builds peak performance in all Soldiers. It is the foundation of unit readiness. In an\\nera of multi-domain operations all Soldiers must be able to fight and win in both defensive and offensive\\noperations that occur without notice. The goal of the Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F) System is to build\\nphysical lethality and mental toughness to win quickly and return home healthy. See ATP 7-22.01 for H2F\\ntesting, and ATP 7-22.02 for H2F drills and exercises.\\nThe principal audience for FM 7-22 is leaders at all organizational levels. All leaders are trainers. Leaders\\ninclude officers, warrant officers, noncommissioned officers, and those Department of the Army (DA)\\nCivilians in leadership positions. Trainers and educators throughout the Army will also use this publication.\\nCommanders, staffs, and subordinates ensure that their decisions and actions comply with applicable United\\nStates, international and in some cases host-nation laws and regulations. Commanders at all levels ensure\\nthat their Soldiers operate in accordance with the law of war and the rules of engagement. (See\\nFM 6-27/MCTP 11-10C.)\\nThis FM is derived from DODD 1308.1 and DODI 1308.3. AR 350-1 directs the Army\u2019s mandatory training\\nrequirements. Commanders and staff will establish training programs consistent with AR 350-1 and FM 7-\\n22 and in consultation with their H2F teams and master fitness trainers (MFTs). Training that addresses both\\nthe physical and nonphysical aspects of Soldier readiness is considered by senior Department of Defense\\n(DOD) leadership to be essential to mission success.\\nThis publication comprises the strategic underpinning of the Army\u2019s H2F System.\\nTerms included in the glossary are not codified Army terms. They are included only for clarity for the reader.\\nThis publication is not a proponent for any Army doctrine terms.\\nFor emphasis, the names of specific drills and exercises are title cased in this publication only.\\nThis doctrine and the regulations that support it apply to the Active Army, the Army National Guard/Army\\nNational Guard of the United States and the United States Army Reserve, unless otherwise stated.\\nThe proponent for this publication is the United States Army Center for Initial Military Training\\n(USACIMT), Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC).

Performance readiness experts of the H2F System will assess each Soldier\u2019s physical and\\nmental status and design programs to sustain or improve that Soldier\u2019s ability to meet the demands of their\\nmilitary occupational specialties (MOSs), duty assignments, and combat-specific tasks. This individualized\\napproach is sustained across the Soldier\u2019s Army career. It represents a cultural shift from the industrial scale\\napproaches of the past where massed formations received the same training in a one-size-fits-all approach\u2014\\noften with no equipment or expertise required to lead the training. It also represents a shift from expecting\\nindividual Soldiers who often train remote from their units to independently develop and implement a\\nperformance training program. The H2F System addresses those individual Soldiers\u2019 needs, too. Figure\\nintroduction-1 illustrates the H2F System.\\nFigure Introduction-1. The Holistic Health and Fitness System\\nThis doctrine directs leaders and Soldiers to use unit-level experts, facilities, and equipment to develop the\\nphysical and nonphysical components of Soldier readiness. This doctrine has evolved from the lessons\\nlearned, Soldier feedback, and Soldier testing throughout a prolonged period of ground combat. Lessons\\nlearned in that period are combined with the best performance and medical science to prepare Soldiers for a\\nwide range of threats in complex operational environments. The H2F System is an immersive, comprehensive\\napproach to readiness centered on brigade-owned H2F facilities and personnel.\\nIn the initial phase of H2F, recruits and new Soldiers will train to perform the Occupational Physical\\nAssessment Test (OPAT) and prepare to conduct warrior tasks and battle drills (WTBD), high physical\\ndemand tasks (HPDTs), and the Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT). In the sustaining phase of H2F, Soldiers\\nwill continue to build readiness. From their first units of assignment (FUAs) to separation from the Army,\\nthey optimize and mitigate the rate of loss of physical and mental preparedness for any mission at any time.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 xiiiIntroduction\\nUsing this doctrine, Soldiers will sustain high levels of foundational performance for extended periods. They\\nwill know how to quickly develop peak physical performance along with the mental toughness required of\\noperational assignments. They will be ready to deliver collective overmatch in multi-domain operations, win\\nquickly, and return home healthy.\\nThe H2F doctrine is divided into four parts: system, design, build, and deliver.\\nPART ONE: SYSTEM\\nThe H2F System has five critical elements: governance, program, equipment and facilities, personnel, and\\nleadership education. These elements are distilled from careful doctrine, organization, training, materiel,\\nleadership and education, personnel, and facilities (known as DOTMLPF) analysis and research into past and\\npresent H2F-related initiatives. Each element is critical to creating a system for Soldier readiness.\\nGOVERNANCE\\nIn the H2F System, the governance element is defined as the command and control, regulations, policies,\\nevaluation and resourcing provided by DA H2F leadership. For the H2F System to work it must be\\nimplemented properly. Governance at the senior leader levels ensures consistent adoption, application and\\ncompliance.\\nH2F System governance includes an Army H2F steering committee, an Army H2F Capability Development\\nIntegration Directorate, and an Army H2F Program Manager. These groups work with existing Army\\norganizations and industry, inform science and technology efforts, and integrate H2F programs and\\ninitiatives.\\nOther key components of the governance element are surveillance and quality control, enabling leaders to\\ntrack program execution and program results to hold subordinate leaders and trainers accountable.\\nGovernance allows the H2F System to be rapidly modified based on outcomes and lessons learned.\\nPROGRAM\\nThe program element for the H2F System is the doctrinal description of how leaders will implement the H2F\\nSystem in their units. The program includes the five domains of physical readiness, nutritional readiness,\\nspiritual readiness, mental readiness, and sleep readiness. The doctrine provides the foundation for all Soldier\\nreadiness programs. It is the standard to optimize Soldiers\u2019 performance as they move about the Army and\\nthe battlefield. The physical programming includes a much broader range of physical readiness training\\nmodalities than has previously been described in doctrine. It includes programs such as Army Water Survival\\nTraining, Running Skill, and Pregnancy and Postpartum Physical Training. The program also includes\\nnonphysical domains of readiness. Nutritional readiness emphasizes eating for performance in garrison and\\noperational settings. Spiritual readiness is contextualized for all Soldiers and their leaders against the Army\u2019s\\nmoral and ethical fabric without regard for specific religious beliefs or traditions. Mental readiness includes\\ntechniques to improve cognitive thinking skills, emotional control, and interpersonal skills. Sleep readiness\\ndirects Soldiers on the proper dosing and techniques for maintaining the health of their most important body\\npart\u2014the brain.\\nPERSONNEL\\nThe personnel element in the H2F System are those Soldiers, government service and contracted performance\\nexperts who are assigned to brigade-sized units. They have been validated by the Army as experts in H2F\\nprograms and know how to synchronize each domain to optimize Soldier readiness. These personnel form\\nthe commander\u2019s H2F performance team\u2014a team dedicated to performance readiness. They include\\nindividuals such as physical therapists, registered dietitians, occupational therapists, and strength and\\nconditioning specialist and athletic trainers. These highly qualified experts work with the brigade chain of\\ncommand, unit-level H2F trainers, master fitness trainer (MFT) instructors, and ACFT graders, as well as\\nunit medical and installation personnel to develop and coordinate performance readiness.\\nxiv FM 7-22 1 October 2020Introduction\\nEQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES\\nThe equipment and facilities element in the H2F System refers to the world-class, standardized training\\nequipment and facilities organic to the unit. The facility, known as the Soldier Performance Readiness Center\\n(SPRC), houses the unit\u2019s H2F personnel in a space open all day on a schedule that accommodates the unit\u2019s\\nphysical and nonphysical training, readiness education, and performance coaching. The SPRC keeps Soldiers\\nfocused and motivated to build their personal readiness in a setting in which they can safely progress\\nalongside all members of their unit\u2014including new Soldiers and those who are pregnant, deconditioned, ill,\\nor injured. The SPRC provides a supportive individually-focused environment where comprehensive,\\nintegrated, and immersive physical and nonphysical programming is delivered. In locations in which a unit\\nhas not contracted or adopted a SPRC, leaders will adapt existing facilities and other programming modalities\\nto meet the intent of the command.\\nLEADER EDUCATION\\nThe fifth H2F element, leader education, describes H2F education that Soldiers receive across their career.\\nSoldiers and their leaders must understand the foundations, standards, and rationale for the H2F System and\\nrequisite resources. Leaders must understand their roles as trainers, resource providers, role models, and\\ncoaches. These roles depend on their grade and assignment. Their professional military education must\\ncontain more than a casual understanding of this doctrine. Leaders must fully understand all H2F topics to\\ninclude the physiological and psychological foundations of the H2F programs in their units. Command teams\\nand their Soldiers must know and understand the tasks, conditions, and standards described in this doctrine\\nand how to develop and execute periodized programs on the training field and in the SPRC. Leader\\neducation\u2014delivered through professional military education (known as PME), cadre and pre-command\\ncourses\u2014self-development settings, and civilian education programs will be contextualized for rank and\\nmission.\\nPART TWO: DESIGN\\nPart Two explains the scientific basis of Soldier performance and how the H2F training program is designed.\\nSoldier physiology, periodization, and program design approaches describe the \u201cwhy\u201d of H2F\u2014the basic\\nscience and rationale behind the program. This foundational information helps leaders understand how to\\nbuild health and fitness programs for individual Soldiers and collective unit readiness and deployability.\\nPART THREE: BUILD\\nThe Army builds Soldier H2F performance in two phases using the programs described in this doctrine:\\ninitial phase and sustaining phase. Both phases prepare Soldiers for a lifetime of optimized health and fitness.\\nAs a Soldier\u2019s understanding of his or her potential matures, the H2F System will consistently build the most\\neffective training to leverage his or her best performance.\\nINITIAL PHASE\\nThe initial phase lasts from accession to FUA and builds foundational and fundamental skills. Most of these\\nskills will be acquired in the time between recruiting station and the completion of initial military training\\n(IMT). Recruiters administer the OPAT to certify that a recruit is ready for the rigors of training. Physical\\nand nonphysical training prior to IMT is conducted by the individual recruit in the Future Soldier Program\\n(FSP), guided by information in this doctrine. OPAT competencies are progressed and further validated\\nduring IMT with HPDT assessments and the ACFT. Training in IMT is conducted mostly in collective\\nsettings with relatively limited access to individualized H2F programming when compared to sustaining\\nphase training.\\nSUSTAINING PHASE\\nSustaining phase prepares Soldiers for mastery of the physical and nonphysical attributes of their\\noccupational tasks, duty positions, and combat.

For remotely-located Soldiers, H2F programming is available through other modalities, including\\nnovel future platforms\u2014such as mobile applications and health and fitness information websites and\\nvideos\u2014that tailor programs to a remotely located Soldier\u2019s resources and his or her readiness goals.\\nPART FOUR: DELIVER\\nPart Four provides examples of schedules and content of the H2F programs that leaders can use to help\\ndevelop unit physical and nonphysical readiness training.\\nxvi FM 7-22 1 October 2020PART ONE\\nSystem\\nThe Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F) System is the organizational structure required\\nto implement H2F doctrine across the Army to optimize Soldier lethality.\\nChapter 1\\nPrinciples and Elements\\nThe H2F System is comprised of five critical elements: governance, program,\\nequipment and facilities, personnel, and leader education. These elements are essential\\nto the future success of Army readiness. They ensure and sustain Soldier readiness.\\nThese elements are driven by three governing principles: optimization,\\nindividualization, and immersion. This chapter discusses the principles and elements\\nof the H2F System.\\nPRINCIPLES\\n1-1. The H2F System formalizes the way the Army trains, develops, and cares for Soldiers. This shift marks\\na change that will continue to evolve over the next twenty to thirty years. The H2F System builds both the\\nunderlying capability and capacity within the Soldier. Similar to professional athletes, Soldiers will optimize\\ntheir individual performance potential and well-being by becoming stronger, faster, and more ready in both\\nthe physical and nonphysical domains. Stronger individuals ultimately produce stronger teams.\\n1-2. It integrates the domains of H2F into tactics, techniques, and procedures that represent a cultural shift\\nfrom a focus on physical readiness to an expanded readiness paradigm that includes how Soldiers think, feel,\\nand interact with their environment. An understanding of the Soldier has always been essential in the history\\nof warfare. This doctrine describes the system of training and testing that prepares the Soldier for 21st century\\nwarfare. The H2F System directs the training of the whole Soldier\u2014the body and the brain\u2014using the most\\nmodern and best methods. This doctrine explains the \u201chow\u201d and the \u201cwhy\u201d of the Army\u2019s approach to\\ndeveloping Soldier readiness\u2014the foundation of every unit\u2019s ability to deliver overmatch on the battlefield.\\nIt combines the sciences of health and fitness with the art of coaching and mentoring for individual program\\ndevelopment, goal setting, motivation, and team building\u2014the capabilities that provide the basis for\\ncollective proficiency.\\n1-3. Commanders and other leaders ensure adherence to H2F doctrine through unit training plans and the\\npriorities and execution of collective training to maximize the operational readiness of the unit. The principles\\nthat drive the H2F System are optimization, individualization, and immersion.\\nOPTIMIZATION\\n1-4. Optimization of the training program leads to the most rapid improvement in foundational Soldier\\nreadiness in the initial phase and the building of high levels operational readiness in the sustaining phase.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 1-1Chapter 1\\nThroughout a Soldier\u2019s career, optimal programming has the secondary effect of preventing degradation in\\nperformance and behavior that might negatively impact readiness.\\n1-5. H2F doctrine recognizes that Soldier readiness depends on the proper combinations of physical fitness\\n(such as strength, speed, and endurance) and foundational health (such as the cardiovascular, respiratory,\\nimmune, and hormonal systems) that are optimized through careful attention to nutritional readiness, mental\\nreadiness, spiritual readiness, and sleep readiness. Nutrition\u2014the food, beverages, and supplements in a\\nSoldier\u2019s diet\u2014provides the nutrients needed to meet the physical demands of training and combat. Soldiers\\nmust also maintain mental readiness\u2014the exceptional mental flexibility and endurance, outstanding self-\\ninitiative and superior judgment required in combat. Spiritual readiness supports individual and collective\\nreadiness as Soldiers negotiate challenging moral and ethical situations in training or operational\\nenvironments. Finally, proper sleep sustains brain function, cognition (thought processing), the immune\\nsystem, and recovery after physical activity.\\nINDIVIDUALIZATION\\n1-6. For most of its history, the Army has used an industrial-scale approach to physically train its\\nformations. The optimal physical fitness of the individual was constrained by the need to raise the fitness of\\nthe whole. H2F doctrine shifts the focus to individualized training programs with continuance of training in\\na collective setting. From 2020, the Army will train the whole of each individual Soldier to ensure the\\nreadiness of the Army. The H2F System supports that approach with expert H2F performance teams,\\nequipment, and facilities. It uses the best exercise science and best coaching practices to assess each Soldier\\nand customize to his or her needs. Each Soldier, regardless of physical condition, has his or her own program.\\nA periodized, purposeful physical training program implemented across the enterprise allows Soldiers to\\nmove from one duty station to another without interruption in their readiness training progression.\\n1-7. Training schedule development for individual Soldiers and units is a complex process. Several\\nvariables impact the ability to apply one training schedule across all of the Army. These variables include\\nhow units fill, the length of the training cycle, time until deployment, cadre-to-Soldier ratios, shift work,\\navailability of H2F personnel, equipment and facilities, military occupational specialty (MOS)-specific\\ntraining, and environmental (austere, hot, cold, and seasonal) considerations. The H2F System will provide\\nthe best training approaches to accommodate these variables and implement rational, optimized programs.\\nIMMERSION\\n1-8. Immersive programming owned by and delivered in the unit builds cohesion, \u00e9sprit de corps, and trust.\\nWithin a standardized system (where unit readiness resources and outcomes are similar across the enterprise),\\ndifferent unit needs drive variations in the training program to meet the demands of resource constraints,\\norganizational changes, and new mission sets. H2F doctrine links physical and mental training domains, and\\ndoes so in a system staffed and equipped at levels equivalent to those found in elite performance settings.\\nThe facilities, equipment, personnel, and leader education elements described in this doctrine make the\\nperformance readiness training experience an immersive one. Immersive training makes the best choice the\\nonly choice. It provides the most comprehensive pathway to optimize lethality and ensure overmatch in multi-\\ndomain operations.\\nELEMENTS\\n1-9. The H2F System is comprised of five critical elements: governance, program, equipment and facilities,\\npersonnel and leader education. These elements are essential to the success of Army readiness. They ensure\\nand sustain Soldier readiness. See figure 1-1.\\nGOVERNANCE\\n1-10. The Army\u2019s strategic leaders are responsible for the readiness of the Army and the overall governance\\nof the H2F System. Strategic leaders establish the policies and regulations, define objectives, allocate\\nresources, and implement quality controls to deliver performance readiness. This is the governance process.\\n1-2 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Principles and Elements\\n1-11. The H2F System aligns and integrates numerous health and fitness programs in the Army under a\\nsingle governance structure. The governance process ensures efficient and effective H2F programming,\\nprovides the necessary emphasis and support to secure resources, and prioritizes effort based on strategic\\nobjectives. All performance optimization efforts coalesce under the single governance of the H2F System to\\nintegrate evidence-based approaches for optimized performance readiness.\\nFigure 1-1. The elements of the Holistic Health and Fitness System\\n1-12. When properly designed, governed, and adopted, the H2F System creates a performance readiness\\nplatform that prevents physical and nonphysical stress from overwhelming the Soldier. The most important\\ncomponent of the governance process is compliance. Leaders at all levels must comply with policy,\\nregulation, doctrine, and intent of H2F to enable Soldiers to reach the goal of H2F: optimized performance.\\n1-13. Volatility in programming, disparate approaches, and deviations from the standard become evident in\\nunits very early in training cycles. In the H2F System, high performing units are encouraged to share their\\nbest practices. The Army\u2019s H2F leadership, Centers of Excellence, and H2F schoolhouse will disseminate\\nthe training doctrine across the enterprise and professional military education. This approach will reduce the\\nunpredictability in readiness training that Soldiers currently experience as they move among units and across\\noperational environments.\\n1-14. The ability to provide oversight and support, collect and disseminate best practices, develop funding\\nrequests, and conduct assessments depends upon the H2F personnel in the unit and their unit leadership.\\nHowever, without command authority, no accountability exists to assess and reset H2F initiatives,\\neffectiveness, or redundancy. This Army\u2019s H2F special staff provides strategic leadership and future direction\\nfor H2F doctrine, policy, personnel training, and development.\\n1-15. The United States Army Center for Initial Military Training (USACIMT) is the Army lead for Holistic\\nHealth and Fitness. USACIMT\u2019s H2F Directorate is responsible for doctrine and training development. The\\n8 October 2020 FM 7-22, C1 1-3Chapter 1\\nH2F Directorate coordinates H2F personnel, equipment, facilities, and services contracts. The H2F\\nDirectorate collects and analyzes data relating to H2F operations across all locations and with all supported\\nelements. USACIMT develops and promulgates lessons learned and best practices as well as provides\\ntechnical expertise and quality control for the H2F System.\\n1-16. Governance includes providing program standards, surveillance, analysis, research and evaluation of\\nthe H2F System. This is a critical priority. It informs leaders on the status of the force as well as readiness of\\nthe Army. Effective assessment and analysis of the system outcomes prevents the diversion of resources and\\nenergy into ineffective programming that does not support the continuous progress of a Soldier\u2019s readiness\\nfrom unit to unit, installation to installation, across his or her Army career.\\nSTANDARDS\\n1-17. As described in Army and Department of Defense (DOD) regulations, commanders and other leaders\\nare responsible for training to regulatory and doctrinal standards. They execute the planned training described\\nin this doctrine. Standards remain constant as performance levels increase, but the conditions become more\\ndemanding.\\nSURVEILLANCE\\n1-18. The H2F surveillance system aims to develop tangible, results-oriented, actionable information\\ndesigned to answer the commander\u2019s critical information requirements: \u201cWhat forces do I have, what is my\\nsurge capability, what is my risk if I reallocate force, what is the readiness of my force, and do all my\\nsubordinate commands have the same readiness picture?\u201d\\nBIOMETRIC DATA\\n1-19. Centralized collection and analysis of data from wearable technology, H2F personnel observation, and\\nSoldier inputs or surveys allows coaches and mentors to set training goals, develop training programs, track\\nthe effects of training, and adjust training to improve performance. Examples of H2F biometric data points\\ninclude sleep efficiency and duration, foot time, training intensity and duration, exercise heart rate, and power\\noutput.\\nSURVEY DATA\\n1-20. Survey data focus on the individual Soldier\u2019s health and fitness outcomes to direct changes to improve\\nhis or her deployability. Surveys conducted by H2F performance experts and Soldier self-reports identify the\\nearly onset of physical and psychological dysfunction.\\nINSPECTION DATA\\n1-21. Staff assistance visits and unit inspections give commanders real-time knowledge of the unit\u2019s program\\nand readiness status. See AR 1-201 for details on inspections.\\nRESEARCH AND ANALYSIS\\n1-22. Analysis informs decisions about changes to individual Soldier and collective programming. Regularly\\nconducted, empirical research and analysis allows for immediate adjustments to training cycles. These data\\npermit adjustments to training and testing standards as well as development of unbiased health and fitness\\nrecommendations to improve readiness.\\nPROGRAM\\n+1-23. FM 7-22 is the overarching program for the H2F System\u2014the authoritative doctrine for the way the\\nArmy conducts physical and nonphysical readiness training for individual Soldiers and units. This four-part\\ndoctrinal publication and its two Army techniques publications describe how to design, build, deliver, and\\ntest the individual Soldier and unit H2F program. It explains the basics of human anatomy and performance\\nphysiology that are the foundation for program design. It includes detailed guidance on nutritional and sleep\\n1-4 FM 7-22, C1 8 October 2020Principles and Elements\\nstrategies for all Soldiers in garrison and deployed settings. Sleep and nutrition are critical in the performance\\nof physical and mental tasks. Special programs are included for water survival training, running skills, free\\nweight training, and pregnancy and postpartum training. Mental readiness is addressed through training on\\ncognitive, emotional, and interpersonal skills. Spiritual readiness addresses the development of qualities\\nderived from a person\u2019s worldview\u2014religious, philosophical, or human values\u2014needed to endure times of\\nstress, hardship, and tragedy.\\n1-24. The H2F System uses deliberate and purposeful training to build Soldier performance. Deliberate\\ntraining uses proven methods and standards. Purposeful training uses the proper training volume, intensity,\\nand frequency while targeting goals based on Soldier-specific tasks. Soldier training is never static. Soldiers\\nbenefit from positively revising their training approach and finding the best strategy to improve performance.\\nThe H2F System will provide a strength and conditioning specialist to ensure Soldiers conduct purposeful\\ntraining sessions in support of rational longer-term goals. This adherence to a professionally-designed and\\nsupervised training program will facilitate compliance and rapid progress during the initial phase of training,\\nand more incremental gains in the sustaining phase. The sustaining phase is the vast majority of the Soldier\u2019s\\ncareer span.\\n1-25. Because of H2F, Soldiers tend to make better readiness choices when training and garrison life reflect\\nan environment that makes proper behavior and decision making the most likely choice. The program is\\nimmersive; it does not depend upon appointments away from the unit or online, nor on self-management\\ntraining systems. It does not pull Soldiers away from their work environment nor push them to complete\\ntraining elsewhere. The architecture in the unit\u2014both the fixed facility architecture and the framework of\\ntraining concepts\u2014supports choices that support H2F goals. It is a face-to-face daily program of instruction\\nconducted by the primary H2F personnel. Individual weaknesses are addressed in real time by a professional\\nteam of unit-owned personnel in a unit-owned facility. Unit leaders, who also have their own individual H2F\\nprograms, understand the tenets of the system and are accountable for their unit\u2019s results.\\n1-26. The doctrine includes training templates to cover a variety of conditions and constraints. This doctrine\\nrecognizes that Soldiers and units in remote locations may not have the full complement of H2F trainers,\\nfacilities, and equipment. Templates provide examples to speed execution of and compliance with the H2F\\napproach anywhere in the world. They provide a foundation to address the programming needs of the unit.\\nSee Part Four beginning on page 13-1 for templates for training programs such as initial entry training, first\\nunit of assignment (FUA), and pre-deployment periods.\\n1-27. Basic combat training templates incorporate progressive resistance and strength training for the Army\\nCombat Fitness Test (ACFT). Seven-day schedules include active recovery, strength, endurance and speed\\ntraining sessions conducted in the Army physical fitness uniform (known as APFU) and Army combat\\nuniform (ACU). In the 10-week block of basic combat training, the ability to complete several different\\nperiods of training is limited and maximal performance potential will have to be realized in the sustaining\\nphase.\\nPERSONNEL\\n1-28. Personnel in the H2F System are located in units across the Army\u2014all Components, all geographic\\nregions.\\n1-29. The H2F School is a future capability that will optimize existing competencies within the U.S. Army\\nPhysical Fitness School with emergent H2F capabilities to become the Army\u2019s premier teaching facility for\\nperformance readiness. The H2F School will be staffed with Regular Army and Army civilian instructors\\nwho are qualified to train and certify unit-level H2F personnel in Army-specific requirements. For\\nprofessionally-credentialed personnel, H2F instructors will conduct resident courses as well as installation-\\nbased courses across the Army via mobile training teams. Sister schools in the One Army School System\\n(known as OASS) will provide trained H2F personnel to National Guard and Reserve Soldiers. At a\\nminimum, graduates from the H2F School will receive the H2F additional skill identifier (known as ASI).\\nAs the H2F System matures and the skills needed for H2F trainers expand, noncommissioned officers\\n(NCOs) will be selected for MOS training at the H2F School.\\n8 October 2020 FM 7-22, C1 1-5Chapter 1\\n1-30. The H2F Performance Team Program Director serves as special staff to the brigade commander. The\\nH2F performance team is owned by the unit. H2F performance team leaders have backgrounds and\\noccupational specialties in exercise and rehabilitation sciences. They serve in operational units and in United\\nStates Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) units at the Army\u2019s training centers.\\n1-31. H2F performance teams will advise their commanders on performance readiness issues to integrate\\nH2F in mission planning and personnel decisions. Serving as special staff to the commander, these advisors,\\neducators, and training leaders ensure that standardized H2F programming is implemented. H2F leaders will\\npossess the knowledge to provide feedback on preventable H2F threats to the Soldier readiness mission. They\\nlead the implementation of the appropriate countermeasures through Soldier training and education in\\ncoordination with other members of the H2F performance team and unit leadership.\\n1-32. The H2F performance team of experts and administrators designs, builds, delivers and tests the unit\u2019s\\nH2F program. With command support, the H2F performance team and Soldier Performance Readiness\\nCenter (SPRC) promote an optimal readiness mindset\u2014a culture of readiness that flows from meticulous\\nattention to detail and compliance with the H2F program. H2F permeates every military operation no matter\\nwhat size and scale. For example, H2F occupational and physical therapists move with their command teams\\ncirculating during combat training center rotations to eliminate medical evacuations from field training\\nexercises (FTXs). In a special operations unit in Afghanistan, a quick reaction team\u2019s physical therapist and\\nperformance psychologist move out to a mountain team coming off a tough mission. Their presence\\ndemonstrates that the unit cares about the team. The team rules out the need to evacuate, reviews\\nreconditioning and recovery exercises, checks exercise equipment, and reassures Soldiers about minor aches.\\nThis biological, psychological, and sociological approach facilitates the healing process and a quick return\\nto the fight. Soldier lethality is sustained by the deployed H2F performance team.\\n1-33. The H2F performance team assigned to a brigade-sized element generally consists of the personnel\\nspecialties described below and outlined in figure 1-2:\\n\\uf06c The H2F Program Director advises commanders on performance readiness issues and integrates\\nH2F into mission planning and personnel decisions.\\n\\uf06c The H2F Facility Manager maintains functionality and readiness of the unit\u2019s SPRC facility.\\n\\uf06c The Nutrition Programs section coordinates nutrition education and training programs, providing\\nindividual and group performance nutrition counseling and education to enhance the combat\\nperformance of Soldiers in training and missions.\\n\\uf06c The injury control section consists of physical therapists and athletic trainers:\\n\\uf0a7 The physical therapy team provides a full range of professional injury screening, evaluation,\\ndiagnosis, and treatment in close proximity to where Soldiers train.\\n\\uf0a7 Athletic trainers provide evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of acute musculoskeletal\\nconditions before, during, and after physical readiness training.\\n\\uf06c The Physical Training Programs section consists of physical strength and conditioning specialist\\nwho develop, coordinate, execute, and manage individualized strength and conditioning programs\\nfocused on unit mission and individual Soldier tasks.\\n\\uf06c The Cognitive Enhancement Programs section includes occupational therapists and a cognitive\\nenhancement specialist:\\n\\uf0a7 Occupational therapists focus on improving cognitive performance skills, mental and\\nemotional skills, and interpersonal skills to optimize individual, team and unit cohesion and\\nperformance.\\n\\uf0a7 The cognitive enhancement specialist manages and provides cognitive enhancement\\neducation and tailored training programs for individuals and teams by operationalizing\\nresilience core competencies and addressing mental barriers to physical performance.\\n1-34. In addition to H2F performance team, the brigade has the following resources assigned to augment\\nH2F programming:\\n\\uf06c Brigade unit ministry team (UMT):\\n\\uf0a7 Chaplain.\\n\\uf0a7 Religious affairs specialist.\\n1-6 FM 7-22, C1 8 October 2020Principles and Elements\\n\\uf06c Brigade surgeon\u2019s office:\\n\\uf0a7 Brigade surgeon.\\n\\uf0a7 Brigade physical therapist.\\n\\uf0a7 Embedded behavioral health expert.\\n\\uf06c Brigade logistics staff officer (S-4) food service advisor.\\n1-35.

H2F performance team structure\u2014tier 1 brigade\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 1-7Chapter 1\\n1-36. Training brigade H2F performance teams are responsible for educating Soldiers about physical\\nreadiness, nutritional readiness, mental readiness, spiritual readiness, and sleep readiness as well as the\\nimportance of these domains in building and maintaining Soldier readiness. It is during initial entry training\\nthat Soldiers receive the fundamentals for establishing and maintaining their personal H2F.\\n1-37. Army Reserve and National Guard H2F personnel are controlled and supported by their headquarters\\nor the state where they work. They are certified in the same One Army School System as their Regular Army\\ncolleagues. Once certified, these Soldiers work full-time in their unit or state providing H2F training either\\nto a pre-determined number of Soldiers within a geographical area (city, county, region, or district) or to\\nSoldiers attending training at a reserve training center, armory, regional training institute or professional\\neducation center, or SPRC equivalent.\\n1-38. Like their Regular Army Soldiers, Army Reserve and National Guard H2F master trainers have civilian\\nor Army certification or licensure in the exercise sciences. They have prior experience in military and\\ncollegiate performance settings. When daily individual and collective training is not feasible, Army Reserve\\nand National Guard H2F trainers use face-to-face assessments and needs analyses to develop individual\\nprograms they can conduct remotely. Follow-up appointments and small group training sessions,\\ncomplemented by online performance platforms for remote and deployed Soldiers are used to build and\\ndeliver Army Reserve and National Guard Soldier readiness. H2F trainer instructors mentor, test, monitor,\\nand report compliance of Army Reserve and National Guard Soldiers. In partnership with recruiters, they\\nprepare National Guard recruits for the Occupational Physical Assessment Test (OPAT) and Future Soldier\\nProgram (FSP).\\n1-39. The manning solutions for Army Reserve and National Guard depend upon the state and unit size and\\nthe geographic distribution of Soldiers. In a typical scenario, the state\u2019s H2F performance team consists of\u2014\\n\\uf06c One H2F State Coordinator (physical therapist, strength and conditioning specialist, certified\\nmental performance consultant, general schedule [GS]-13 or contractor ) with the following\\ncredentials:\\n\\uf0a7 Graduate degree in health professions (administration or treatment) or exercises sciences.\\n\\uf0a7 Certification as H2F master trainer instructor by and instructed previously in H2F School.\\n\\uf0a7 Management of state H2F performance team.\\n\\uf0a7 Coordination of physical and nonphysical programming with partner institutions (Military\\nEntrance Processing Command [known as MEPCOM], United States Army Recruiting\\nCommand [USAREC], colleges and universities, commercial partners, Veterans\\nAdministration, and nongovernmental organizations).\\n\\uf06c Six H2F master trainers (strength and conditioning specialist, sergeant first class [SFC], GS-11,\\nor contractor) with the following credentials:\\n\\uf0a7 Bachelor\u2019s degree in exercise science.\\n\\uf0a7 Completed coursework in sport or performance psychology.\\n\\uf0a7 Strength and conditioning specialist.\\n\\uf0a7 Certification in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (known as CPR) and automatic electronic\\ndefibrillator (known as AED).\\n\\uf0a7 Certification H2F master trainer by H2F School.\\n\\uf06c 1 Registered Dietitian (GS-12 or contractor) with the following credentials:\\n\\uf0a7 Coordination of nutrition services.\\n\\uf0a7 Army Body Composition Program (ABCP) trainer and subject matter expert for the state.\\n\\uf0a7 Master\u2019s degree in nutrition.\\n\\uf0a7 Board certified specialist in sports dietetics (known as CSSD).\\nEQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES\\n1-40. Equipment and facilities are essential to the success of the H2F System. H2F programming is delivered\\nvia the SPRC. The Army standard for a brigade-sized unit is a 40,000 square foot SPRC. The SPRC serves\\n1-8 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Principles and Elements\\nas the unit-owned, fixed facility hub that delivers a comprehensive, immersive training experience for the\\nindividual Soldier. See figure 1-3 for a prototype of the Performance Readiness Center.\\nFigure 1-3. Prototype brigade-sized Soldier Performance Readiness Center\\n1-41. The SPRC houses the offices and treatment, teaching, and counseling spaces for the H2F performance\\nteam. It is open on a schedule that accommodates the unit\u2019s H2F training and workplace needs. Company-\\nor platoon-sized units rotate into the building several times per week to receive H2F education, individual\\nprogramming, specialized training and coaching from H2F performance team members.\\n1-42. The SPRC\u2019s outdoor training areas include an obstacle course, ACFT testing lanes and track, terrain\\nrunning course, sheltered strength training racks, containerized strength equipment, physical training fields,\\nand climbing pods. In an ideal H2F community of practice, this life support area includes medical treatment,\\nbarracks, Army and Air Force Exchange Service (known as AAFES) and morale, welfare, and recreation\\n(known as MWR) facilities that comply with the H2F approach to optimizing readiness. They create\\nenvironments of exclusively healthy choices. See figures 1-4 and 1-5 on page 1-10 for illustrations of training\\nareas.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 1-9Chapter 1\\nFigure 1-4. Sample terrain run and obstacle course\\nFigure 1-5. Schematic of an outdoor strength training area\\n1-10 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Principles and Elements\\nLEADER EDUCATION\\n1-43. Leader investment is essential to promote, train, prioritize, and improve the readiness of Soldiers and\\nunits. Leaders drive cultural change by providing the resources for that change. The success or failure of the\\nH2F System depends upon the quality of its leadership. Leadership is the process of influencing Soldiers by\\nproviding purpose, direction, and motivation. Unit leaders are responsible for the success of the H2F System\\nand are accountable for their unit\u2019s results. They have to be highly aware of how the H2F System works,\\nwhich requires much more than scheduling and supervising the training. New knowledge acquisition is\\nrequired by leaders at all levels of the Army. H2F encompasses knowledge domains that are not typically\\nowned by one expert. However, because these domains impact the success of the Soldier in the garrison and\\non the battlefield, Army leaders must understand these domains.\\n1-44. The goal of H2F leadership education is to prepare leaders to communicate, understand, establish, and\\nsupport H2F within their organizations. Leaders must understand their organizational role from supervising\\nto training to resourcing. Whether in command or not, Army leaders possess the knowledge of best practices.\\nThe result of this leader education is improved compliance with H2F programming, a reduction in the\\ndisparity of readiness programming, and a marshalling of resources. There will be a reduction in the\\nlikelihood and severity of physical and psychological injury or disease. These outcomes occur when leaders\\nunderstand the value and utility of the H2F System.\\n1-45. The leadership education element of the H2F System builds awareness and sustains mastery so that\\nleaders can set the example of optimal readiness across the physical and nonphysical domains. When leaders\\nextend themselves completely in strenuous training, Soldiers more often follow their example. When Soldiers\\nfeel their chain of command believes in H2F to the extent that the chain of command regularly engages in\\nthe activities, Soldiers are motivated to greater effort. The unprepared, hesitant leader loses the confidence\\nand trust of Soldiers almost immediately. The well-prepared, confident leader gains the respect and\\ncooperation of all Soldiers at the outset and builds greater \u00e9sprit de corps.\\nINSTITUTIONAL TRAINING DOMAIN\\n1-46. The Army\u2019s institutional training domain includes Army training centers, functional schools, and\\nprofessional military education. This domain includes the centers of excellence and schools in TRADOC.\\nH2F instruction is embedded in institutional training and other leader development schools. Examples might\\ninclude\u2014\\n\\uf06c Basic combat training (BCT): training for Soldiers to learn to fully cooperate with their leaders\\nand fellow Soldiers. Orderly movement of Soldiers requires a precise and unified effort. A Soldier\\nlearns that a team works smoothly when every Soldier does his and her part. Each Soldier learns\\nto respond to commands and learns what fellow Soldiers must do. This teamwork is established\\nthrough the medium of drills. Drills teach Soldiers where to place their feet and arms during\\nexercises, how to march, and how to handle a weapon. Over the course of BCT, Soldiers find pride\\nin their teams\u2019 unified response to command.\\n\\uf06c United States Army Medical Center of Excellence contextualized training for enlisted Soldiers\\nand officers in medical professional military education and MOS-specialty coursework to enable\\nbetter, rapid H2F support to the units they serve. Examples include H2F master trainer certification\\nfor occupational therapists, behavioral health providers, physical therapists, and physical therapy\\nspecialists.\\n\\uf06c United States Military Academy: H2F master trainer certification as course requirement prior to\\ncommissioning.\\n\\uf06c Reserve Officer Training Corps: H2F master trainer certification as a course requirement prior to\\ncommissioning.\\n\\uf06c Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences: applied human performance optimization\\ncourses for medical providers in the Army\u2019s medical system.\\n\\uf06c Integration into officer initial military training (IMT) and professional military education to\\ndevelop leader H2F skills at each echelon.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 1-11Chapter 1\\nOPERATIONAL TRAINING DOMAIN\\n1-47. The Army\u2019s operational training domain is the training that units perform while at home station, at\\nmaneuver combat training centers, during joint exercises, at mobilization centers, and while operationally\\ndeployed. In preparation for managing these operational training situations, H2F leader education occurs in\\nunit professional development classes. Examples include the following:\\n\\uf06c NCO basic, advanced, and senior leader courses.\\n\\uf06c Squad-level H2F leader course taught by a battalion\u2019s H2F performance team.\\n\\uf06c Phase II of the H2F master trainer certification course.\\nSELF-DEVELOPMENT TRAINING DOMAIN\\n1-48. The Army\u2019s self-development training domain is the planned and deliberate learning that reinforces\\nand expands the individual Soldier\u2019s H2F knowledge. It complements institutional and operational training\\nand enhances understanding of the H2F System\u2019s principles and best practices. Examples include:\\n\\uf06c Distributed learning (Phase I of the H2F master trainer course)\\n\\uf06c Civilian and commercial certifications.\\n\\uf06c College-level classes in exercise and sports sciences and human performance optimization.\\nHolistic Health and Fitness System\\nHolistic health and fitness (H2F) is the Army\u2019s Soldier readiness system for physical\\nand nonphysical training. The Army enables it with the five enduring elements of\\ngovernance, program, personnel, equipment and facilities, and leadership education.\\nThe H2F program must meet the commander\u2019s training goals to develop and maintain\\na high level of readiness appropriate to the unit\u2019s mission-essential task list, individual\\nSoldier duty positions, and challenges of multi-domain operations.\\n1-12 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Chapter 2\\nPhases\\nThe Army builds H2F training and testing across a Soldier\u2019s career span in two phases:\\ninitial and sustaining. The training is based on an assessment of the needs of the Soldier\\nand the unit. The testing validates that training has met the readiness needs of the\\nSoldier and by extension his or her unit. This part of the doctrine discusses the two\\nphases of the H2F System.\\nINITIAL PHASE\\n2-1. Initial phase training builds foundational and fundamental skill in Soldiering tasks: shoot, move\\ncommunicate, survive and protect or treat. Within these tasks are physical and mental skills that Soldiers\\nmust acquire before the completion of IMT. Training prior to IMT is driven by the individual recruit in the\\nFSP guided by information in this doctrine and the recruiter. Drill sergeants and their fellow cadre (who\\ninclude H2F performance team members) conduct training in IMT in large, collective formations using H2F\\nfacilities and equipment.\\n2-2. Initial phase training includes the FSP, BCT, advanced individual training (AIT), one station unit\\ntraining (OSUT), Warrant Officer Candidate School (known as WOCS), Warrant Officer Basic Course\\n(known as WOBC), basic officer leader courses, and the time spent acclimating to the FUA. Due to the\\nvarying lengths of these IMT programs, some Soldiers who finish sooner may stay in the initial phase after\\nmoving to their FUA until they are physiologically ready to move to sustaining phase activities. By the time\\nSoldiers have completed six months of IMT, they are ready to move to the sustaining phase. H2F performance\\nteams provide individual training and testing for those Soldiers who need more time to adapt.\\n2-3. If a Soldier reaches the sustaining phase standards during AIT or OSUT, he or she can begin sustaining\\nphase training. Progression to sustaining phase activity should not be an automatic expectation. Soldiers will\\narrive at their FUA medically ready, physically fit, disciplined, and lethal with their weapons. The variety of\\ntime spent in IMT means that some Soldiers\u2019 physiological preparedness may not be at the same level as\\nothers. As discussed in Chapter 12, new Soldiers may have to modify training until they can safely join\\nsustaining phase training.\\n2-4. Initial phase training is much more prescriptive than sustaining phase training for these important\\nreasons:\\n\\uf06c Untrained and deconditioned individuals must adhere to a training program that mitigates the\\nrelatively high risk of injury.\\n\\uf06c Initial phase Soldiers must learn the standard movements required for Soldiering.\\n\\uf06c Prescriptive, collective training is most feasible when there is a high trainee-to-cadre ratio.\\n\\uf06c Shared training experiences instill cohesion and improve the Soldierization process.\\nFUTURE SOLDIER PROGRAM\\n2-5. The FSP prepares individuals for the OPAT and the rigors of IMT. Detailed information for\\ncommanders in charge of preparing individuals and recruits for the physical demands of IMT is found in Part\\nFour.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 2-1Chapter 2\\nBASIC COMBAT TRAINING\\n2-6. The 10-week H2F program for BCT provides foundational readiness and fundamental physical and\\nmental skills. New Soldiers report to BCT with various levels of potential. The first weeks of training focus\\non general progression of physical readiness. To minimize the risk of injury, Soldiers must perform exercises\\ncorrectly, precisely, and with gradually increasing intensity. To imprint the motor skills required for\\nfundamental physical demand tasks, Soldiers repeat the exercises and drills, like the common Soldier tasks,\\nas frequently and with as much attention to detail as possible. The schedules in this doctrine, when executed\\nto standard, provide the proper training intensity and volume to improve training and testing outcomes and\\ncontrol attrition.\\n2-7. H2F performance team in BCT includes physical therapists, registered dietitians, athletic trainers,\\nstrength and conditioning specialists, and H2F master trainers. The H2F performance team can train large\\nformations using this doctrine and can evaluate Soldiers who fall below BCT and H2F goals. The H2F\\nperformance team gives Soldiers conditioning programs that improve their performance. Conditioning\\naccounts for adaptive physiological changes that take longer than ten weeks. Soldiers who require longer\\nthan this to meet Army standards to progress to AIT will move to the fitness training unit (FTU).\\n2-8. H2F physical training for BCT incorporates the following:\\n\\uf06c Weight training.\\n\\uf06c Seven-day schedules to include active recovery sessions to maximize response to training.\\n\\uf06c Strength, endurance and sprint training ability groups.\\n\\uf06c Sessions conducted in the ACU.\\n\\uf06c Running skill training.\\n\\uf06c Soft-tissue and joint mobilization techniques for recovery.\\n\\uf06c The ACFT.\\n2-9. The nonphysical domains of H2F:\\n\\uf06c Nutritional readiness.\\n\\uf06c Mental readiness.\\n\\uf06c Spiritual readiness.\\n\\uf06c Sleep readiness.\\nADVANCED INDIVIDUAL TRAINING\\n2-10. AIT focuses on technical and MOS-oriented subjects. Therefore, H2F training should prepare these\\nSoldiers to meet the physical and nonphysical requirements of their FUA. H2F performance teams continue\\nto conduct initial phase training until Soldiers meet Army standards before transitioning to sustaining phase\\nactivities. A 14-week AIT schedule is included in Part Four beginning on page 14-21.\\nONE STATION UNIT TRAINING\\n2-11. OSUT follows similar progression as BCT for the first 10 weeks and then continues initial phase\\nactivities until Soldiers have met the Army\u2019s standards for sustaining phase. Sustaining phase activities are\\nmore complex and prepare Soldiers to perform the requirements of their MOS assignments and multiple\\ndomain operations. MOSs with 22-week OSUT will be programmed by the H2F performance team in those\\nschools. A 22-week OSUT schedule is included in Part Four beginning on page 14-27.\\nFIRST UNIT OF ASSIGNMENT\\n2-12. After completing IMT, Soldiers arrive at their first unit within a few days or weeks. The break between\\ndeparture from IMT and arrival at the first unit may cause Soldiers\u2019 readiness to degrade. Significant losses\\nin strength, endurance, and mobility occur after 14 days of little or no training. The degradation is more\\nsignificant in newly trained Soldiers who do not already have high levels of physical readiness. IMT leaders\\nand H2F performance teams understand this and encourage and motivate Soldiers to accept responsibility to\\nmaintain their own readiness. H2F performance team members and unit leaders at the Soldiers\u2019 first\\n2-2 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Phases\\nassignment are also aware of this. They design and organize conditioning programs that expedite the new\\nSoldiers\u2019 acclimatization to the unit and movement into sustaining phase training. These programs may last\\nfrom a few days to several weeks.\\nSUSTAINING PHASE\\n2-13. Sustaining phase H2F training builds upon the foundation established in initial phase. The sustaining\\nphase creates mastery of the physical and mental attributes of occupational and combat tasks. Developing\\nindividualized programs for Soldiers will be the norm in sustaining phase. This is possible in sustaining phase\\nbecause each unit or installation will have the requisite H2F System. For National Guard and remotely located\\nSoldiers, regional H2F performance team members within each state (available as consultants to individuals\\nand units) develop and implement H2F training. Equipment and facility support will be through unit facilities\\nand other training venues.\\nWARRANT OFFICER CANDIDATE SCHOOL\\n2-14. H2F training and testing in Warrant Officer Candidate School employs sustaining phase programming\\nthat prepares warrant officer candidates for their FUAs.\\nWARRANT OFFICER BASIC COURSE\\n2-15. The Warrant Officer Basic Course will continue requirements established in Warrant Officer Candidate\\nSchool for the various durations of Warrant Officer Basic Course. These may include and are not limited to\\nphysical and nonphysical training domains.\\nBASIC OFFICER LEADER COURSES\\n2-16. Cadets and officer candidates report to an accessions basic officer leader course with various levels of\\nphysical and nonphysical readiness. They will have passed the OPAT. The first weeks of training focus on\\nprogressive training of the whole body. Similar to BCT, cadets and officer candidates in an accessions basic\\nofficer leader course perform initial phase training. They learn fundamental physical skills as well as the drill\\nand ceremony that they will use to lead Soldiers. Officers in a branch basic officer level course transition to\\nsustaining phase activities once they have passed the ACFT.\\n2-17. To minimize the risk of injury and overtraining, the intensity and volume of training progresses\\ngradually. Commanders, cadre, and H2F performance teams should evaluate each new cadet or officer\\ncandidate who falls below an accessions basic officer leader course standards and should give special\\nassistance to improve performance. More training is not necessarily better. The quality and quantity of\\ntraining should be assessed with an understanding that some cadets and officer candidates may require\\nadditional time to make the improvements required to meet Army standards.\\nACTIVE COMPONENT\\n2-18. The goal of H2F is to improve each Soldier\u2019s physical and nonphysical readiness to survive and win\\nin any operational environment. The H2F System enables the Army to provide campaign-capable,\\nexpeditionary forces. Commanders are responsible for the training, performance and readiness of their\\nSoldiers, and use the training management cycle and resources to meet H2F objectives. See ADP 7-0 for\\ntraining.\\n2-19. The Army\u2019s unit training plan discussed in ADP 7-0 provides the framework for commanders to\\nachieve proficiency in their units\u2019 mission-essential task lists (METLs). The unit METL drives training. Key\\nto the success of this process is the inclusion of bottom-up feedback. This approach applies mission command\\nto the training process. Mission command is the Army\u2019s approach to command and control that empower\\nsubordinate decision making and decentralizes execution. With this approach, senior leaders provide training\\nfocus, direction, and resources. Subordinate leaders develop training objectives and training requirements\\nspecific to the unit and provide feedback on training proficiency.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 2-3Chapter 2\\n2-20. At each level of a unit\u2019s hierarchy above the squad or team, H2F performance team members starting\\nwith H2F master trainers are available to advise on and implement H2F training. These members identify\\nunit needs and train to standard according to the unit training plan or the published training schedule. They\\nanalyze tasks and identify both collective and individual tasks that support the higher headquarters METL\u2014\\nthe bottom-up feedback. Over time, structured, recurring periods of H2F training increases unit readiness.\\n2-21. Commanders should establish H2F program goals based on the physical and nonphysical requirements\\nof the unit\u2019s METL or mission. Commanders use this process and H2F performance team personnel to\\nidentify training requirements for the unit\u2019s mission and to subsequently plan, prepare, execute, and assess\\nall H2F training. This is the process for effective H2F governance within the unit. This process is critical to\\nensure proper readiness outcomes of the unit\u2019s H2F program.\\nRESERVE COMPONENT\\n2-22. With operational deployments increasing in recent times, United States Army Reserve (USAR) and\\nArmy National Guard of the United States (ARNG) Soldiers have made up about half of the personnel\\nengaged in current conflicts. In this increasingly busy operational period, and with civilian occupational\\ndemands further restraining time to train, Army Reserve and Army National Guard Soldiers understand the\\ncritical importance of time to optimize individual readiness well above and beyond physical fitness test\\nstandards. It is critical that Reserve Component commanders use the Army training management cycle to\\nsupport their units\u2019 METLs.\\n2-23. Army Reserve and Army National Guard Soldiers typically perform occupational and operational tasks\\nthat are the same as their Regular Army counterparts. However, they may have lower fitness levels because\\nthey conduct mandated physical readiness training less frequently throughout the year. As such, some\\nReserve Component Soldiers may be at greater risk of injury and have physical performance deficits.\\n2-24. The H2F program gives Soldiers the motivation and knowledge they need to conduct their own quality\\ntraining sessions between unit collective training or when they are off-base or in remote locations. H2F\\nperformance teams at unit assemblies incorporate H2F activities from this field manual into individual\\nschedule for drill (inactive duty training) periods. Most of the activities support Reserve Component unit\\nMETLs. Therefore, during assemblies, H2F personnel teach one aspect of a high-priority domain\u2014for\\nexample, Running Drill 2 for strength improvement\u2014for Soldiers to practice on their own. Many of the\\nexercises in require no or very little equipment, so Soldiers can practice individually if facilities are not\\nreadily available. When Soldiers require equipment, for weight training for example, most military and\\ncivilian physical training facilities commonly have it.\\n2-25. Given the restraints on training Reserve Component personnel, the H2F System provides a program to\\nmonitor and motivate regular, systematic training of these Soldiers. Monitoring is important\u2014especially if\\nthe Army pays Soldiers to maintain standards or awards them promotion points for success on fitness tests.\\nMonitoring compliance with training is accomplished in the future applications (mobile applications). The\\napplication details each training session conducted remotely by capturing a mix of automatic monitoring\\n(heart rate, elevation change, step cadence, and Global Positioning System) and self-reporting rating of\\nperceived exertion (RPE), satisfaction with the workout, and self-reported readiness level. The application\\nsends results to H2F performance team personnel and the unit command. The application adjusts programs\\nto raise the Soldier\u2019s self-reported readiness level and to meet the unit\u2019s mission. The mobile application can\\nconnect Soldiers to unit and partner training sessions, which improves teamwork, cohesion, and aspiration to\\ndo well.\\nINDIVIDUAL TRAINING\\n2-26. Soldiers in the Army Reserve Troop Program Unit and Army National Guard, and many Soldiers in\\nthe Regular Army (such as recruiters, shift workers, criminal investigators, Army school cadre, foreign area\\nofficers, and defense attaches) depend on information in this doctrine for H2F programming. The H2F System\\nsupplies them with the knowledge and support they need to prepare for their occupational and combat tasks.\\nSoldiers who work and train on their own must make every effort to conduct H2F physical and nonphysical\\ntraining throughout their work weeks. The program works best when it becomes a normal way of daily life,\\n2-4 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Phases\\nincorporating and complying with the best nutritional readiness, mental readiness, spiritual readiness, and\\nsleep readiness as well as physical readiness training techniques and procedures.\\n2-27. All Soldiers must understand that it is their personal responsibility to achieve and sustain a high level\\nof readiness. Individual H2F training is designed to improve each Soldier\u2019s contribution to the unit\u2019s\\nreadiness. Strength and conditioning drills, movement skill, mental training drills, mindfulness exercises,\\nsleep readiness, and performance nutritional practices can be mastered individually or with a partner. The\\nSoldier who immerses individually in the practices builds readiness equivalent to any Soldier doing the same\\nin a collective setting.\\nCONDENSED TRAINING\\n2-28. When scheduled training requirements, environmental considerations, or FTXs conflict with the\\ndesignated time available for H2F training, leaders may condense the sessions. This applies in both initial\\nand sustaining phases. These sessions, while being shorter and therefore less likely to meet unit readiness\\ngoals, may still have a focus to them. Table 2-1 illustrates two examples of condensed physical training\\nsessions. One session focuses on strength and one focuses on endurance.\\nTable 2-1. Condensed holistic health and fitness sessions\\nSession RPE Sustaining Phase Time\\nPreparation: PD (5 reps)\\nStrength 6 Activities: GD (1 rep); CD1 & CD2 (5 reps), or deadlift. 30\u2019\\nRecovery: RD (20 secs)\\nPreparation: PD (5 reps)\\nEndurance 6 Activities: MMD2; 60-120s (4 reps) 30\u2019\\nRecovery: RD (20 secs)\\nCD conditioning drill RD recovery drill\\nGD guerilla drill rep repetition\\nMMD military movement drill RPE rating of perceived exertion\\nPD preparation drill secs seconds\\nPhases\\nThe two phases of the Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F) System, the initial phase and\\nthe sustaining phase, cover the Total Army. From the start of the initial phase as a new\\nrecruit until completion of the sustaining phase when Soldiers become Army careerists,\\nthey will be immersed in a comprehensive H2F System that optimizes their readiness.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 2-5This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 3\\nDomains\\nThe overarching goal of the H2F System is Soldier readiness. This goal is met when\\ntraining in the five domains of H2F is optimized. These domains are physical readiness,\\nnutritional readiness, mental readiness, spiritual readiness, and sleep readiness. To\\nconduct rigorous, demanding training that inspires Army pride, imbues the Soldier\\nethos, and maximizes common task competence, Soldiers must be physically and\\nmentally motivated and engaged.\\nPHYSICAL READINESS\\n3-1. If the overarching goal of H2F is Soldier readiness, then the overarching physical training goal is\\nmovement lethality\u2014the ability to physically engage with and destroy the enemy. Movement lethality is the\\nability to apply and sustain the right amount of strength, endurance, and speed to meet the demands of training\\nand combat physical tasks. This physical goal is supported by optimal mental function. The goal and the\\nfunction are inseparable, linked together. The ability to tolerate physical duress is a function of mental\\ntoughness. It is generated by training the critical components of physical readiness and the tasks they support\\n(see table 3-1).\\nTable 3-1. Physical components and occupational tasks\\nPhysical Component Occupational Tasks\\nMuscular strength Lift, drag, and carry heavy loads\\nMuscular endurance Execute sustained bouts of low intensity resistance\\nAerobic endurance Execute sustained bouts of low intensity movement\\nAnaerobic endurance Execute short-duration, high intensity movement\\nPower Complete short-duration, explosive movements with heavy loads\\n3-2. Figure 3-1 on page 3-2 illustrates the prerequisites for movement lethality. Components of fitness,\\nenergy systems, occupational skills, and physical skills required for movement lethality must be carefully\\ncombined over time with a Soldier\u2019s structural capabilities. Structural capabilities are the intrinsic capabilities\\nthat allow a Soldier to perform physically. See table 3-2.\\nTable 3-2. Structural capabilities\\nStructural Capability Description\\nLoad tolerance The ability of the skeletal system to bear weight.\\nFlexibility The range of motion across single or multiple joints that allows the body to be\\npositioned for optimal movement.\\nStatic balance The ability to maintain a stable position over a base of support.\\nBody composition The percentage of lean muscle and other body tissues.\\nBone density The thickness and quality of the bone that provides its strength.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 3-1Chapter 3\\nFigure 3-1. Tasks and physical components of movement lethality\\n3-3. Structural capabilities support the training and improvement of the movement skills. See table 3-3.\\nTable 3-3. Movement skills\\nMovement Skill Description\\nAgility The ability to bend, rotate and twist in the frontal, transverse, and sagittal\\nplanes and use that ability to change direction.\\nCoordination The ability to synchronize limb, torso and head movements at varying speeds\\nof motion.\\nDynamic balance The ability to move under control at speed and under load.\\nKinesthesia The perception of the body\u2019s position in space during movement.\\nPace The ability to set the correct speed of an activity to manage fatigue.\\nPerception The understanding of correct technique and effort that builds skill.\\nReaction time The interval between an external stimuli and the Soldier\u2019s response.\\n3-4. Movement lethality has to be taught and learned with meticulous attention to the precise replication of\\nthe movements required in occupational tasks and combat. Movement skill must be deliberately and\\npurposely progressed until it becomes a natural part of Soldier performance in training and in contact with\\nthe enemy.\\n3-5. One characteristic of movement\u2014speed\u2014serves as an example. Speed improves with the proper\\ndevelopment of aerobic and anaerobic energy systems along with muscular strength and endurance. Drills\\nand exercises are the means to cultivate this improved end state. Speed is a word often associated with \u201cfast.\u201d\\nSome drills such as 30:60s, 300 Meter Shuttle Runs, and Hill Repeats promote fast speed. Others such as the\\nLateral, the Lunge Walk, and the Soldier Carry develop precise, slower movement competencies. The\\nmovement skill associated with speed, therefore, is pace\u2014the ability to control the rate at which you move.\\nPace can be deliberately progressed by ensuring that a Soldier is exerting himself or herself correctly. This\\nrequires an understanding of effort. Soldiers can train and measure effort while executing these drills by using\\n3-2 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Domains\\nthe RPE scale\u2014a Soldier\u2019s estimate of how hard he or she is working. This training integrates into the\\nSoldier\u2019s ability to avoid fatigue, or arrive too soon at an objective.\\nPhysical Readiness\\nPhysical readiness is the ability to meet the physical demands of any duty or combat\\nposition, move lethally on the battlefield, accomplish the mission and continue to fight,\\nwin, and come home healthy.\\nNUTRITIONAL READINESS\\n3-6. Nutritional readiness has evolved over the past four decades from a series of disjointed ideas and one-\\nsize-fits-all guidelines into an evidence-based science promoting integrated and personalized practices.\\nWhereas earlier efforts were based on static recommendations focused on the fuel needs for endurance sports,\\ncontemporary performance dietary guidelines are mission- and individual-driven and periodized to enhance\\nreadiness.\\n3-7. The goal of nutritional readiness is to promote optimal performance readiness. For Soldiers to perform\\noptimally throughout their careers in assignments with varying levels of mental and physical difficulty, they\\nmust place as much emphasis on nutrition programming to support that performance as they do on physical\\nand mental health. Nutritional readiness intertwines with the other readiness domains since it promotes and\\nis supported by optimal physical readiness, mental readiness, spiritual readiness, and sleep readiness.\\n3-8. A comprehensive performance nutrition program is proactive, active, and reactive:\\n\\uf06c Proactive. Proactive nutrition provides the foundation for baseline health and homeostasis\\n(physiological equilibrium)\u2014the proactive prevention of nutrition deficiency, chronic disease and\\nimmune system compromise.\\n\\uf06c Active. Active nutrition fuels the arduous activities and events Soldiers perform as part of their\\noccupations and covers fueling before during and after these events. It comprises the largest\\nportion of this section.\\n\\uf06c Reactive. Reactive nutrition centers on specific dietary interventions to treat illness, injury, or\\nmedical conditions and spans hospitalization through rehabilitation to return to full duty.\\nNutritional Readiness\\nNutritional readiness is the ability to recognize, select, and consume the requisite food\\nand drink to meet the physical and nonphysical demands of any duty or combat\\nposition, accomplish the mission and come home healthy.\\nMENTAL READINESS\\n3-9. Mental readiness is the capacity to adapt successfully in the presence of risk and adversity. It can be\\nseen as a set of personality traits, an assortment of skills or ways of behaving and thinking, or a combination\\nof both personality traits and behaviors. Whether Soldiers think of mental readiness as something they have\\n(such as a personality trait or disposition), something they do (such as a plan, strategy, or way of behaving),\\nor something they believe (such as a faith, positive outlook, or neutral outlook), it will help Soldiers better\\nunderstand uncertain situations and will make them aware of their own mental processes.\\n3-10. Under extreme duress, mental readiness is the ability to create a sense of total control and confidence.\\nIn the presence of chaos and uncertainty, possibility for flawed judgment increases. Mental readiness reduces\\nmiscalculation and errors of judgment. Soldiers who are mentally ready can manage severe stress and grow\\nmentally tougher in the process.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 3-3Chapter 3\\n3-11. Mental readiness depends on a range of the following factors:\\n\\uf06c Character.\\n\\uf06c Behavior.\\n\\uf06c Resilience.\\n\\uf06c Cognitive skill.\\n\\uf06c Social acuity.\\nCHARACTER\\nIntrinsically, character is one\u2019s true nature including identity, sense of purpose, values,\\nvirtues, morals, and conscience. Character, in an operational sense, is an Army\\nprofessional\u2019s dedication and adherence to the Army Ethic, including the Army Values, as\\nconsistently and faithfully demonstrated in decisions and actions.\\nAR 600-100, The Army Profession and Leadership Policy\\n3-12. Character is a complex, multi-factorial construct. It is a Soldier\u2019s true nature including identity, sense\\nof purpose, values, virtues, morals and conscience. These personal qualities help the Soldier to determine\\nwhat is right and to become more dedicated and adherent to the Army ethic and Army Values. A Soldier of\\ncharacter is an honorable servant, an Army expert, and a steward of the Soldier profession\u2014his or her way\\nof life. A Soldier who demonstrates strength of character becomes, most essentially, a trusted leader.\\n3-13. The process of character development in the Army starts during the accessions process. The civilian\u2019s\\ntransformational experience, his or her Soldierization, continues in IMT. Through deliberate, career-long\\nprofessional education and experience, leaders and H2F performance teams who interact with Soldiers\\nreinforce character strength every day. They coach, counsel, mentor, and influence Soldiers during physical\\nand nonphysical training. Soldiers model ethical reasoning and decision making that reflect the attitudes and\\nbehaviors of their leaders.\\nBEHAVIOR\\n3-14. Behavior is the outward expression of character. It combines a Soldier\u2019s verbal and nonverbal actions,\\nwritings, photos, and videos that inform the world about that Soldier. No matter what background and set of\\nvalues a Soldier brings to the Army, all Soldiers understand that they are required to adhere to the Army\u2019s\\npolicies, regulations, doctrine, and values. The extent that Soldiers are open to and committed to these values\\nand ethics is reflected in their behavior.\\nRESILIENCE\\n3-15. Resilience is the ability to face and cope with adversity; adapt to change; and recover, learn, and grow\\nfrom setbacks. Resilient Soldiers can better leverage mental and emotional skills and behaviors that promote\\nenhanced performance and optimize their long-term health.\\n3-16. The Army considers resilience to be a key component of Soldier and unit readiness. Resilient leaders\\ncan recover quickly from setbacks, shock, injuries, adversity, and stress while maintaining their mission and\\norganizational focus. They can foster this capacity in their Soldiers through leading by example and with\\ntough, realistic training. Leaders who learn in the presence of stress and grow from it build resilience.\\nResilience helps leaders and their units fight and win and continue to fight and win. Resilient leaders carry\\ndifficult missions to their conclusion.\\nCOGNITIVE SKILL\\n3-17. Cognitive skill is the ability to expand and integrate knowledge into decisions. It drives the ability to\\nmake sound decisions. It is built through the instruction and absorption of personal and professional\\nexperience and education, values, and beliefs. It should not be difficult for Soldiers and leaders to understand\\nthe link between high levels of cognitive skill and optimal performance on the battlefield. Low cognitive skill\\nleads to poor decision making and misconduct behaviors.\\n3-4 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Domains\\n3-18. Key measures for Soldiers and leaders to use in assessing cognitive skill include the following:\\n\\uf06c Attention or attentiveness, memory or recall.\\n\\uf06c Integration of concepts, data, inputs, and orders.\\n\\uf06c Reasoning: problem solving and decision making.\\n\\uf06c Understanding.\\nSOCIAL ACUITY\\n3-19. Social acuity is the awareness of, control over, and ability to manage interactions with others. High\\nsocial acuity or social intelligence is the ability to read other people\u2019s cues and then act appropriately.\\nEmotionally intelligent Soldiers can interact with others with an awareness of, control over, and an ability to\\nappropriately express their own emotions.\\n3-20. Three useful measures of Soldier social acuity are task cohesiveness, Army identification, and social\\ncohesiveness.\\n\\uf06c Task cohesiveness is the motivation to achieve the Army\u2019s goals and objectives, which leaders\\ngenerally assess at the Soldier level and aggregate at the unit level. In other words, each Soldier\u2019s\\ncommitment to the unit\u2019s goals is assessed and aggregated across the unit as a measure of the\\ngroup\u2019s task cohesiveness. A higher level of task cohesiveness directly correlates with increased\\nmorale, operational effectiveness, and ultimately improved odds of survival.\\n\\uf06c Army identification and commitment is the extent to which a Soldier feels that he or she is similar\\nto and can relate to the Army. It is the extent to which a Soldier feels a part of the Army and finds\\nthe Army personally meaningful or fulfilling.\\n\\uf06c Social cohesiveness is the motivation to develop and maintain social relationships within the unit.\\nLike task cohesiveness, leaders generally assess it at the Soldier level and aggregate it at the unit\\nlevel.\\nMental Readiness\\nMental readiness is the ability to meet the mental demands of any combat or duty\\nposition, adapt successfully in the presence of extreme risk and adversity, accomplish\\nthe mission, and continue to fight and win.\\n+ SPIRITUAL READINESS\\n3-21. Spiritual readiness is the ability to endure and overcome times of stress, hardship, and tragedy by\\nmaking meaning of life experiences. Individuals find meaning as they exercise beliefs, principles, ethics, and\\nmorals arising from religious, philosophical, and human values. Soldiers who successfully develop, sustain,\\nand repair their state of being while facing adversity demonstrate spiritual readiness. Leaders who understand\\nspiritual readiness can encourage personal spiritual readiness by creating a climate of mutual respect and\\ndignity that promotes dialogue, fosters team cohesion, and enables healthy free exercise of religion or no\\nreligion. This approach enables collective and individual readiness.\\n3-22. Spiritual readiness strengthens as individuals identify their spiritual dimension\u2014their purpose, core\\nvalues, beliefs, identity, and life vision. The spiritual dimension draws on an individual\u2019s core religious,\\nphilosophical, or human values to develop an individual\u2019s sense of motivation, character, and integrity. The\\nspiritual dimension defines the essence of a person by enabling one to build inner strength, make meaning of\\nexperiences, behave ethically, persevere through challenges, and be resilient when faced with adversity.\\n8 October 2020 FM 7-22, C1 3-5Chapter 3\\nSpiritual Readiness\\nSpiritual readiness includes the development of the personal qualities needed to\\nsustain a person in times of stress, hardship, and tragedy. These qualities come from\\nreligious, philosophical, or human values and form the basis for character, disposition,\\ndecision making, and integrity.\\nSLEEP READINESS\\n3-23. To achieve optimal readiness, Soldiers must have sleep and the more sleep obtained the better.\\nInadequate sleep weakens Soldier performance and jeopardizes the mission. Sleep readiness consists of three\\ncomponents:\\n\\uf06c Duration because the health and functioning of the brain depend on the amount of sleep obtained.\\n\\uf06c Timing because the ability to initiate and maintain sleep (and thus maximize the amount of sleep\\nobtained) is strongly influenced by the brain\u2019s internal clock.\\n\\uf06c Continuity because the extent to which sleep is undisturbed by arousals and awakenings influences\\nboth the duration and the depth of sleep. Deeper sleep is more restorative.\\n3-24. The goal of sleep readiness ensures that the Soldier\u2019s brain and body have adequately recovered so that\\nhe or she can tolerate repeated exposure to physical and mental stress. Like the rest of the body (muscles,\\nskin, and internal organs), the brain has physiological needs for food, water, and oxygen\u2014basic needs that\\nmust be met not only to ensure proper brain functioning, but also to sustain life itself. However, unlike the\\nrest of the body, the brain has one additional physiological need: sleep. The brain requires sleep to maintain\\nnormal function. Sleep is necessary to sustain not only alertness, but also higher order cognitive abilities such\\nas judgment, decision making, and situational awareness. In short, sleep makes Soldiers better at being\\nSoldiers.\\nSleep Readiness\\nSleep is the critical requirement for brain health and function. Sleep readiness is the\\nability to recognize and implement the requisite sleep principles and behaviors to\\nsupport optimal brain function. In turn, sleep readiness underpins a Soldier\u2019s ability to\\nmeet the physical and nonphysical demands of any duty or combat position,\\naccomplish the mission, and continue to fight and win.\\nDomains\\nThe five domains of the holistic health and fitness (H2F) program build the Army\u2019s\\nreadiness goals and are based on the principles of optimization, individualization, and\\nimmersion. The goal is to improve each Soldier\u2019s physical lethality and mental\\ntoughness through the linking of physical readiness, nutritional readiness, mental\\nreadiness, spiritual readiness, and sleep readiness.\\n3-6 FM 7-22, C1 8 October 2020PART TWO\\nDesign\\nPart Two explains the scientific basis of Soldier performance and how the H2F training\\nprogram is designed. Training approaches described in Part Two address the \u201cwhy\u201d of\\nH2F\u2014the science and rationale behind the program. The principles discussed in Part\\nTwo form the approaches used in Part Three to build H2F program content for\\nindividual Soldiers and collective unit readiness and deployability.\\nChapter 4\\nPhysiology\\nThe effectiveness of Soldiers depends largely on their physical condition. Combat\\nplaces a premium on the Soldier\u2019s strength, endurance, and lethality. Victory depends\\non these physical attributes. Leaders also recognize that the mind controls the body.\\nTherefore, to persevere in battle and thrive afterward requires an equal measure of\\npsychological health\u2014mental toughness, stamina, emotional fortitude, intellect,\\njudgment, strength of character, and spirituality. The requirement to train all these\\ndomains\u2014physical readiness, nutritional readiness, mental readiness, spiritual\\nreadiness, and sleep readiness\u2014has become more urgent. The inputs that Soldiers and\\nunits will be required to process, and the time to process and act upon them will be\\ninversely proportional. Therefore, the capacity of the unit to be successful rests upon\\nevery Soldier\u2019s ability to respond effectively in the absence of complete information\\nor on short notice. Collective capacity depends on this individual ability. Underpinning\\nall is an understanding of how the human body works\u2014its anatomy and physiology.\\nSOLDIER PHYSIOLOGY\\n4-1. Physiology is the study of the functions and parts of a living organism. This section describes the\\nphysiological and anatomical foundation of Soldier performance.\\n4-2. When the predecessor to the ACFT, the three-event Army Physical Fitness Test (known as the APFT)\\nwas developed in the midst of the Cold War, some senior Army leaders felt ground combat was no longer a\\nforce imperative. As a result, the Army replaced rigorous physical training and assessment linked to the\\nperformance of occupational warfighter tasks with more general fitness training and assessments. This\\napproach mirrored civilian trends with aerobics and jogging driving the popularity of endurance-centric\\nfitness. The three-event Army Physical Fitness Test along with the Army Weight Control Program were\\ndeveloped to ensure a high level of health-related fitness and appropriate body mass.\\n4-3. The lessons learned over three decades of combat operations renewed the Army\\'s focus on the strength\\nand power requirements for ground combat. In 2013, under HQDA directions, the Army began two major\\nphysical fitness assessment studies: (1) Army Required Actions in Support of the Elimination of the Direct\\nGround Combat Assignment Rule (DGCAR), and (2) Comprehensive Study to Determine Baseline Soldier\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 4-1Chapter 4\\nPhysical Readiness Requirements and a Standardized, Baseline Physical Readiness Test. The United States\\nArmy Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM) conducted extensive physical demands\\nstudies to determine the reliability of simulated physical soldiering tasks relevant to combat arms Soldiers.\\nThe studies demonstrated that muscular strength and power drove 60 percent of the variability in physical\\ndemands. In other words, endurance-centric approaches to training and testing did not support all of the\\nbaseline requirements of being a Soldier.\\n4-4. As part of the analysis, USARIEM identified five domains of combat physical fitness: muscular\\nstrength, muscular endurance, aerobic endurance, explosive power, and anaerobic endurance. These five\\ndomains were independently confirmed in the physical fitness assessment studies conducted by the\\nUSACIMT. The Army Physical Fitness Test assessed only two of the five domains of combat physical\\nfitness, aerobic endurance and muscular endurance.\\n4-5. The second objective of the physical fitness assessment studies was to determine common field-\\nexpedient physical fitness test events that predicted a Soldier\u2019s success on the high physical demand warrior\\ntasks and battle drills (WTBD). After surveying MOS schools and several thousand combat veterans on the\\nphysical demands of Soldering, 1,000 Soldiers performed WTBD simulations. Their performance validated\\nthe selection of the six events that became the ACFT.\\nENERGY PATHWAY\\n4-6. Energy to move the human skeleton derives from a series of chemical and biological reactions that\\ninvolve the respiratory system (lungs), cardiovascular system (heart, blood vessels, and blood), the\\nneuromuscular system (nerve and muscle system), and the neuroendocrine system (nerve and hormone\\nsystem). Energy is produced through three pathways\u2014phosphagen, glycolytic, and oxidative\\nphosphorylation\u2014that convert calories into energy. The body can use the resulting energy later in\\nphysiological processes, including but not limited to movement. The onset of exercise activates all three\\npathways, with each one predominating after different durations and levels of effort. Energy is produced in\\nthe form of a chemical called adenosine triphosphate. Adenosine triphosphate is a large molecule comprised\\nof adenosine and three phosphate groups. When this molecule is broken down by chemical reactions in the\\nmuscle, the energy released by this reaction is used for movement.\\nPHOSPHAGEN PATHWAY\\n4-7. In the phosphagen pathway, adenosine triphosphate stored in the muscle and another molecule called\\nphosphocreatine provide the energy for very short duration (5-10 seconds), high intensity or high power\\nactivities. These might include three to five second sprints, the Seated or Standing Power Throw, or maximum\\nrepetition lifts. This type of training rapidly depletes energy available in the muscle cells that require long\\nrest periods to re-energize. If Soldiers do not rest enough or are forced to keep going at this level of intensity,\\nthe loss of adenosine triphosphate causes degraded performance. Depletion of the phosphagen pathway will\\nforce the use of other energy pathways and those pathways will begin to predominate. Rest intervals between\\nbouts of high-intensity exercises should be 2 to 5 minutes to support molecule restoration.\\nGLYCOLYTIC PATHWAY\\n4-8. The glycolytic pathway is the predominant source of energy for high-intensity exercise lasting up to\\n90 seconds. As its name suggests, this pathway breaks down glucose (sugar) in the blood and glycogen (sugar\\ndeposit) stored in the muscle cells. The chemical reactions in this system happen without the need for oxygen\\n(anaerobic reactions). These reactions produce pyruvate or lactate depending on exercise intensity. Pyruvate\\nis a component in the release of stored energy; lactate is a source of stored energy that can be converted back\\ninto glucose or glycogen during exercise. The lactate threshold is the point at which lactate production\\nexceeds its clearance from, or utilization by, the muscle. Soldiers who are more fit have higher lactate\\nthresholds. Across the training period, multiple sets of heavy lifts, Climbing Drills, the Strength Training\\nCircuit, and sprint intervals result in greater overload of the glycolytic pathway and a higher lactate threshold.\\nPrecise measurement of this threshold occurs with an exercise stress test in a laboratory.\\n4-2 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Physiology\\nOXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION\\n4-9. This pathway is the predominant source of energy for low-intensity, sustained exercise lasting for more\\nthan three minutes. This pathway supports aerobic performance. The presence of oxygen allows pyruvate in\\nthe muscle cell to be converted into much more adenosine triphosphate than the other two energy systems.\\nBoth fat and carbohydrate are converted into energy in this system. The process for fat metabolism is called\\nbeta oxidation. Leaders typically use prolonged, low-intensity training such as Foot Marches, Release Runs,\\nand Ability Group Runs to increase aerobic endurance. This type of training encourages the metabolism of\\nfat for fuel. Its use of training uses much shorter rest intervals than the phosphagen pathway. Rests of as little\\nas 5 to 10 seconds are common during low-intensity intervals.\\n4-10. Carbohydrates, the body\u2019s main fuel source, are broken down into glucose and stored as glycogen.\\nGlycogen stores supply about 3,000 kcal in the typical Soldier and are rapidly depleted as exercise intensity\\nincreases. Soldiers may burn 1\u20133 grams of glycogen per minute during exercise and most will run out of\\nglycogen after 1 1/2\u20132 hours of activity. When glycogen stores are depleted, it results in the condition\\nsometimes called \u201chitting the wall.\u201d Soldiers must pay careful attention to nutrition before and during\\nprolonged aerobic activity. For example, to avoid degrading their performance on the 2-Mile Run event,\\nSoldiers avoid depleting glycogen caused by the anaerobic effort of the Sprint-Drag-Carry.\\nVO MAX\\n2\\n4-11. The highest amount of oxygen that can be used during maximal aerobic effort\u2014endurance training\u2014\\nis called the maximal oxygen consumption, or VO max. It is measured as volume (V) in milliliters of oxygen\\n2\\n(O ) consumed per kilogram of body weight per minute, abbreviated to mL/kg/min. A recruit who scores\\n2\\nblack on the OPAT has a predicted VO max of 33 mL/kg/min. Over time and with progressive training, that\\n2\\nrecruit could improve his or her maximal aerobic capacity. Strength training typically results in little or no\\nchange in VO max unless the Soldier uses longer sessions of circuit-type strength training with shorter rest\\n2\\nintervals between exercises. Strength training improves physical performance by increasing relative work\\ncapacity through increases in muscle mass and the improved strength of support structures (see paragraph 4-\\n23). Strength training coupled with circuit training directly increases muscular strength and power, while\\nsupporting the further development of aerobic endurance, anaerobic speed, and muscular endurance.\\nANATOMY\\n4-12. Anatomy refers to the physical structure of the body. Understanding the bones, muscles, and different\\nsystems that form the body helps Soldiers and leaders build better training programs that improve\\nperformance while preventing injuries.\\nBONE\\n4-13. The 206 bones in the human skeleton form both a chassis for muscles to attach to and enclosures to\\nprotect vital structures such as the brain, heart, and spinal cord. Bones store deposits of minerals such as\\ncalcium and phosphorus. Although bones vary in size and shape, some typical features compose a bone\u2019s\\nfunction and bone injury. The outer, hard surface of the bone is the cortex. This strong and stiff tissue is lined\\nby a fibrous layer called periosteum (\u201caround the bone\u201d). The periosteum conveys blood vessels and nerves\\nto the bone and signals pain when bumped or irritated and excruciating pain when fractured.\\n4-14. The softer inner tissue of the bone is the marrow. Bone marrow generates red and white blood cells\\nand platelets. Wherever two bones meet to form a moveable joint in the body (an articulation), the contact\\nsurface of the bone is covered in cartilage. Cartilage is a softer, more fibrous material than the bone cortex\\nand is made of cells that produce collagen. Its purpose is to cushion the bones, especially in weight-bearing\\njoints like the hip, knee, and ankle, and to allow the bones to move more smoothly against each other.\\nCartilage does not have nerve supply, nor as many blood vessels as the rest of the bone. Once it is damaged,\\nit does not repair well. This can lead to pain and inflammation in the joint, otherwise known as arthritis.\\n4-15. Bones are living tissue. They grow larger and longer up to adulthood. Throughout adulthood bones\\nremodel when physical activity stimulates the bone to thicken and strengthen. In response to physical stress,\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 4-3Chapter 4\\ncells called osteoblasts lay down new bone tissue to strengthen the bone, while other cells called osteoclasts\\nreabsorb bone tissue. So long as these two processes are in balance, bone continues to strengthen and remain\\nhealthy.\\n4-16. Poor nutrition and excessive physical training can overwhelm the remodeling process and lead to bone\\nstress injury. Although bone stress injury is less disabling than a traumatic fracture, bone stress injury is an\\navoidable misuse injury often characterized by pain. Doctors treat these injuries with modified physical\\nactivity, rest, and adequate and appropriate nutrition. They occur most often in the metatarsal, tibia, femur\\nand ilium (pelvic bones). Occurring more often in Soldiers in the initial phase of training, bone stress injury\\nresolves as the remodeling process catches up with bone absorption. In some cases, stress injury can progress\\nto a fracture such as a tibial stress fracture. Certain types of stress fractures, particularly to the neck of the\\nfemur, can be medical emergencies with disabling consequences if not immediately stabilized with surgery.\\nMUSCLE\\n4-17. When muscles contract, they pull on bones and cause movement around joints. For example, a biceps\\nmuscle contraction repositions the forearm toward the shoulder as the forearm hinges around the elbow joint\\nas a bicep curl. The resulting force is called torque. When the whole body moves across a marching surface,\\ntorque is created around the point where the foot meets the ground. So long as the body keeps being\\nrepositioned successfully, it will continue to move. If muscles fail to reposition the body\u2019s segments, the\\nbody will lose balance and fall. The body will not move efficiently in the desired direction and it will\\neventually fatigue or become injured\u2014either by misuse or by traumatic contact with the ground or another\\nobject.\\n4-18. Purposeful movement is a function of repeated coordination of forces generated within the body with\\nforces outside the body\u2014intrinsic and extrinsic forces. Practice and coaching builds perception of how to\\nbetter perform basic movements, and subsequently assists with progression to more advanced movements.\\nMUSCLE FIBER\\n4-19. In contrast to the spherical shape of other cells in the body, a muscle cell or fiber is a relatively long,\\ncylindrical microscopic structure. Muscle fibers are packed together in progressively larger groups called\\nmuscle fascicles that form the whole muscle. Muscles have different roles. Some muscles stabilize body\\nsegments, others create large limb movements, or and some create small movements of the hands and fingers.\\nThese small movements are referred to as fine motor control. The function of the muscle will be driven by\\nthe fiber type. There are three muscle fiber types. They are described in paragraphs 4-20 through 4-22 and in\\nfigure 4-1.\\n4-4 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Physiology\\nFigure 4-1. Fiber type training\\nType I\\n4-20. Muscle contractions during low-intensity endurance efforts are mainly assigned to Type I or slow\\noxidative (known as SO) fibers. These fibers are smaller with more mitochondria (parts of the cell that assist\\nwith energy production) and capillaries (blood vessels) surrounding them to deliver more oxygen to the fiber.\\nType I fibers are more resistant to fatigue than the others, but Type I fibers have a slower contractile speed\\nand generate less force.\\nType IIa\\n4-21. During moderate-intensity effort such as one mile runs, Type IIa or fast oxidative-glycolytic (known\\nas FOG) fibers are the main determinants of performance. These fibers\u2019 size, contractile ability, and\\nresistance to fatigue make them the main ones Soldiers should target in their training. Training to build\\nmuscle size (hypertrophy) and strength or using moderate to moderate hard intensity (RPE 8/10) when\\nperforming endurance training recruits more Type IIa fibers. This type of training also encourages the\\nconversion of Type IIx fibers to Type IIa.\\nType IIx\\n4-22. During brief, maximal intensity bouts of exercise (RPE 10/10), Type IIx or as fast glycolytic (known\\nas FG) fibers are recruited. These larger muscle fibers with fast contractile speeds depend on glycogen and\\nhave poor resistance to fatigue. Once Type IIx fibers are recruited, lactate can no longer be cleared from the\\nblood and the lactate threshold is reached.\\nMUSCLE STRENGTHENING\\n4-23. Heavy resistance training is included in physical readiness training so that a Soldier is ready to perform\\nbaseline occupational tasks. This type of training prepares Soldiers for the unplanned extreme load and\\nintensity tasks that he or she might encounter in training, deployment, or everyday life such as responding to\\na motor vehicle accident or moving furniture. A specific real-life example is the case of Army medics at the\\nPentagon who had no notice of the physical and nonphysical demands that would be placed on them on\\nSeptember 11, 2001.\\n4-24. Physical readiness training that stimulates Type II fiber development is necessary for the strength and\\npower development that supports anaerobic tasks\u2014such as heavy lifting, heavy load carriage, fast sprints\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 4-5Chapter 4\\nunder load, and casualty extraction. Low-load resistance training using body weight across relatively long\\nperiods with high repetitions will not permit this type of muscle fiber development. In fact, strength training\\nbegins with a measurement of one repetition maximum\u2014the maximum amount of weight that a Soldier can\\nlift, squat, pull, or push one time. Therefore, Soldiers must train and be tested with weighted resistance above\\ntheir own body weight. Once Soldiers develop new strength, they must sustain it with consistent, repeated\\nexposure to the same or progressive levels of resistance. In some cases, detraining of maximal strength can\\noccur after a three to four week pause in training.\\n4-25. The development of strength training flows from the one repetition maximum measure. As the one\\nrepetition maximum increases over the duration of the Soldier\u2019s career, so will the weight. If the goal of a set\\nis 6 repetitions and the Soldier completes 12, the weight should be increased until no more than 6 repetitions\\ncan be completed in one set. To reduce the amount of trial and error required to hit these targets, the repetition\\nmaximum formula for calculating one repetition maximum can be used: one repetition maximum = (0.033 x\\nrepetitions x weight lifted) + weight lifted. Using the repetition maximum formula, if the three repetition\\nmaximum was 100 pounds, then the one repetition maximum would be 110 pounds. The three repetition\\nmaximum is 90 percent of the one repetition maximum. As the Soldier\u2019s one repetition maximum improves,\\nthen the three repetition maximum increases. A new one repetition maximum of 150 pounds would translate\\nto a three repetition maximum of 135 pounds. If the Soldier was able to deadlift 250 pounds five times in one\\nset, then the one repetition maximum would be 291 pounds.\\n4-26. When preparing to engage in high physical demand tasks (HPDTs), Soldiers must understand the\\ndifference between \u201cabsolute\u201d and \u201crelative\u201d workloads. An absolute workload is the work required to\\ncomplete a physical task. For example, to perform a casualty evacuation or to lift a 95-pound (lb) artillery\\nshell into a rack requires a specific and measurable amount of strength; a long distance foot movement with\\na 100-lb ruck, requires a fixed amount of endurance as well as the muscular strength to carry the load. These\\ntasks represent absolute workloads. Higher absolute workloads require higher physiological capacity. In\\nestablishing training goals an individual must know his or her physiological capabilities and the absolute\\nworkload of the task. The goal should be to increase the rate-limiting physiological capacities (for example,\\nstrength, speed, and endurance) to be able to accomplish higher absolute workloads.\\n4-27. The second aspect of physical work is the \u201crelative workload.\u201d The relative workload compares a given\\ntask or absolute workload to an individual\u2019s maximal physiological capacity. In other words, relative to the\\nmaximum amount an individual could do, how much of that individual\u2019s potential is needed. Relative\\nworkload is defined as \u201cpercent of maximum;\u201d it is a way to calculate the \u201cstrain\u201d on the physiological\\nsystems. If an individual needs to lift a 100-pound object, and his or her maximal strength or lifting capacity\\nis 200 pounds, the relative workload for this task would equal 50 percent. If performing a foot march with a\\nloaded pack requires an oxygen consumption of 2.0 liters per minute and the individual\u2019s VO max is 3.0\\n2\\nliters per minute, the relative workload would equal 66 percent. Therefore, improving absolute workload\\nlowers the relative workload for fixed-demand tasks and reduces the risk of injury. Musculoskeletal injuries\\nare often linked to repeated physical exercise at higher relative workloads.\\n4-28. Soldiers need to know the relative workload, especially for the endurance tasks. Relative workload is\\ndirectly related to \u201ctime to fatigue.\u201d The higher the relative workload, the sooner an individual will fatigue.\\nFor an endurance event, if a person is working at 50\u201370 percent relative workload (of VO max), he or she\\n2\\nwill be able to continue this work for a prolonged period. If the relative workload is greater than 70 percent,\\nan individual will not be able to continue this task for long, and the time needed to recover will increase.\\nSince a higher relative workload may be associated with an increased potential for musculoskeletal injuries,\\nleaders need to extend the Soldier\u2019s rest/recovery time after very high intensity workouts. As Soldiers train\\nand increase their physiological capacities, their increased absolute workload will result in a lower relative\\nworkload.\\nNERVOUS SYSTEM\\n4-29. The nervous system consists of the brain and the spinal cord (the central nervous system) and the\\nnerves branching from them (peripheral nervous system). The nervous system is the body\u2019s master system\\nthat governs the activities of all the other systems including movement, thought, emotions, sensation, illness,\\nand health. Through this system the Soldier senses and responds to the world. Workload accumulates across\\nthe training day if, for example, a Soldier does Squats in the morning and then stands all day in body armor\\n4-6 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Physiology\\nas a range safety. If the Soldier cannot recover properly from the acute training load (the Squat), then the\\ntraining load will accumulate and not be absorbed. The continued volume and intensity of the workload\\nbecomes chronic. This failure to properly progress the workload increases risk of underperformance and\\ntissue damage.\\nCENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM\\n4-30. The right and left halves of the brain, called hemispheres, are divided into lobes. The lobes form an\\nintegrated system that supports all conscious and unconscious functions. The following descriptions of each\\nlobe impact these Soldier function:\\n\\uf06c Frontal lobe contains the premotor cortex and motor cortex, which are the areas that plan and\\nperform movements and contains the Broca\u2019s area for speech production.\\n\\uf06c Parietal lobe processes sensory information, sensory discrimination, and body orientation.\\n\\uf06c Occipital lobe processes signals for visual reception and interpretation.\\n\\uf06c Cerebellum coordinates of voluntary movement, to include walking in a straight line.\\n\\uf06c Brain stem controls breathing, digestion, heart control, blood vessel control, and alertness.\\n\\uf06c Temporal lobe processes auditory reception, expressed behavior, receptive speech, and memory\\ninformation retrieval; it contains Wernicke\u2019s area for speech comprehension.\\n4-31. The size and anatomy of the adult brain is fully developed by age 26. However, this does not mean\\nthat learning ceases. When awake, people are constantly learning. The 12 pairs of peripheral nerves that\\nbranch directly from the brain but remain largely inside the skull are called cranial nerves. They innervate\\n(such as supply with nerves) the muscles and sensory organs of the face and head. The sensory input that the\\ncranial nerves transmit to the brain during daily activities and training become memory. Most of the\\ninformation about these activities becomes short-term memory, stored for a few seconds to allow\\nunderstanding of immediate or near-term events and then discarded.\\n4-32. A fair amount of information is stored as long-term memory. Storage is particularly efficient after\\nsleeping for more than 6 hours the night after the event. These memories last for a few minutes or as far into\\nthe past as it is possible to remember allowing the conscious recall of episodes and facts. Other memories\\n(sometimes called skills) help with the repetition of tasks performed subconsciously such as walking, eating,\\nand driving. Fundamental physical training develops fundamental Soldier skills\u2014move, shoot,\\ncommunicate, survive, and protect or treat\u2014and the long-term memories to support them. Soldiers who have\\nhighly developed motor skills will have very extensive \u201cneural wiring\u201d in their brains related to those\\nactivities. In the well-trained Soldier, particularly the ones who practice the fundamentals, the motions and\\ncontinual decision making needed to perform these combat functions happen without conscious awareness.\\n4-33. Deep in the two lobes of the brain sits the limbic system. This collective term for the structures near\\nthe middle of the brain includes the hippocampus and amygdala. This connection allows the limbic system\\nto impact the endocrine and autonomic motor systems. The limbic system may affect motivation and mood.\\n4-34. The spinal cord is the other major anatomical part of the central nervous system. This thick bundle of\\nnerve fibers connects the brain to the peripheral nerves. It originates in the brain stem and ends in the lumbar\\nspine, protected by the vertebrae.\\nPERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM\\n4-35. At each level of the spine, smaller bundles of nerve fibers split off to form the peripheral nervous\\nsystem. After leaving the spine, the peripheral nerves split and re-form into major nerves such as the median\\nand radial nerve in the arms and the sciatic and femoral nerves in the legs. The peripheral nerves branch into\\nprogressively smaller bundles until a single nerve fiber meets with the part of the body it innervates. If the\\nnerve supplies a muscle cell it is a motor neuron. Where the nerve ending meets the muscle, the connection\\nor synapse is called a neuromuscular junction (known as an NMJ). The types and size of the chemical\\nreactions that occur at the junction drive the amount of force the muscle can generate.\\n4-36. The peripheral nerves originating in the neck (cervical spine) supply sensation and muscle control to\\nthe shoulders, arms, and hands. The largest of these upper extremity nerves are the median, radial, and ulnar\\nnerves. The nerves that supply sensation and muscle control to the legs originate in the lower back. The\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 4-7Chapter 4\\nsciatic nerves pass behind the buttocks and backs of the thighs before dividing to innervate parts of the calf\\nand foot. The femoral nerve courses through the front of the hip and innervates the quadriceps muscle on the\\nfront of the thigh.\\n4-37. Motor neurons regulate how much force is generated by each muscle fiber. If the motor neuron is\\nsevered, the signal from the brain cannot travel along the motor neuron to the muscle. No force will be\\ngenerated. The muscle is said to be paralyzed. Any interruption of the signal along the nerve\u2019s path from the\\nbrain to the muscle due to injury, fatigue, or lack of training will impact the amount of force generated. If the\\nnerve is intact, signals can be sent at increasing speeds to excite the muscle fibers innervated by that nerve.\\nFaster signaling causes more frequent muscle fiber contraction and more force to be generated. Some motor\\nneurons innervate more muscle fibers than others. Those motor neurons involved in large movements or\\ngross motor patterns may innervate a dozen muscle fibers. If a muscle produces complex, small movements\\nor fine motor patterns, its motor neurons may contact several hundred fibers.\\nNEUROENDOCRINE SYSTEM\\n4-38. The neuroendocrine system coordinates the response to exercise across multiple organs and hormone\\nsystems. The neuro part of this system is the autonomic nervous system. The endocrine part is the collective\\nname for glands that can release hormones into the bloodstream. Hormones are chemicals that can alter the\\nway an organ functions. For example, the body releases epinephrine (adrenaline that affects the heart) and\\nnorepinephrine (affects the blood vessels) in response to physical stress.\\n4-39. Like the peripheral nervous system, the autonomic nervous system also lies outside the central nervous\\nsystem. As its names suggests, the autonomic system functions without conscious input to stimulate and\\ncontrol the muscle tissue in the heart, organs, glands, and blood vessels. It therefore impacts the respiratory\\nsystem (lungs), cardiovascular system (the heart, blood vessels, and blood), and organs (kidneys, liver, and\\nstomach), endocrine system, and lymphatic system. The autonomic system has two parts: the sympathetic\\nand parasympathetic systems.\\n4-40. The sympathetic system stimulates cardiac muscle to increase heart rate, whereas the parasympathetic\\nslows it down. Both systems impact the same tissue at the same time to maintain homeostasis, but either can\\nbe turned up to cause a change in response. When the body reaches a resting state, the parasympathetic system\\nis dominant. In this state, the Soldier can better digest calories more efficiently, repair muscle tissue, and\\nsleep.\\n4-41. When the sympathetic nervous system is stimulated by increased activity or threat (physical and\\npsychological stress), it reacts with the fight or flight response. The sympathetic nerves signal\u2014\\n\\uf06c The adrenal gland to release epinephrine and norepinephrine causing the arteries to the heart and\\nmuscles to dilate.\\n\\uf06c The liver to secrete glucose and fatty acids into the blood for quick energy.\\n\\uf06c The pupils to dilate.\\n\\uf06c An increase in sweat to reduce a raised body temperature.\\nCARDIORESPIRATORY SYSTEM\\n4-42. The cardiorespiratory system includes the heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This system takes oxygen\\nfrom small air sacs in the lungs and delivers it through the blood to the muscles so that they can perform\\nwork. The amount of oxygen consumed or metabolized is a measure of how well the respiratory and\\ncardiovascular systems are working during exercise\u2014or how well they are trained. Oxygen is used in\\nchemical reactions inside cells to produce energy. If oxygen is available, muscles can do more work.\\n4-43. During prolonged exercise, the heart must pump more blood to supply and maintain the high levels of\\noxygen required by the working muscles. The frequency of heart beats is referred to as the heart rate. The\\nfrequency of heart beats at rest is called the resting heart rate which is normally about 70 beats per minute\\n(bpm). The resting heart rate for Soldiers with high levels of physical readiness may be well below 70 bpm.\\nFrequency of heart beats during exercise is called exercise heart rate. The exercise heart rate can more than\\ndouble in young adults during maximal effort with a maximum approaching 200 bpm.\\n4-8 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Physiology\\n4-44. The amount of blood pumped (in liters) per beat is the stroke volume (SV) and the cardiac output (Q)\\nis the liters of blood pumped per minute. Q = heart rate (100 bpm) x SV (0.1 liters per beat). Q can be as\\nmuch as 25 to 30 liters of blood per minute in healthy, young Soldiers. As Soldiers become better trained,\\nexercise heart rate goes down and stroke volume goes up, which means Soldiers can work at a higher rate or\\nwork longer at a constant rate with less effort. The Soldiers are fitter. Their relative workload is less and\\ntherefore, the work is easier for them to perform. An example would be, when a Soldier finds it much easier\\nto dig a foxhole after a period of training.\\nPhysiology\\nBalanced training has, at its core, an appreciation for how the human body works\u2014its\\nanatomy and physiology. Knowledge of these sciences supports training that is\\nrational, scientific, and most effectively enhances physical performance while\\nminimizing injury risk.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 4-9This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 5\\nPeriodization\\nAspects of and approaches to training that were developed in the twentieth century\\nincluded components of fitness, principles of training, and new training methods such\\nas intervals, circuits, and periodization. Periodization is the division of training into\\nblocks of time (periods) that focus on building readiness. This chapter describes how\\nall the domains of readiness are included in the periodized approach to training of the\\nH2F System.\\nFUNDAMENTALS OF PERIODIZATION\\n5-1. Periodization is the systematic planning of long- and short-term readiness training and testing in\\npreparation for combat. This logical method of planning training maximizes training outcomes at specific\\nperiods or points in time. In the H2F System, periodization integrates the domains beyond physical\\nreadiness\u2014mental readiness, spiritual readiness, nutritional readiness, and sleep readiness\u2014that prepare a\\nSoldier for combat. The idea of integrating more than just physical training in the periodized model is a more\\nrecent development, especially when applied to team or collective preparation for physical tests or events.\\n5-2. Periodized training divides physical training into logical time periods. Each period\u2014base, build, taper,\\ncombat, and recovery\u2014has a specific training goal that builds on the preceding period. Periods can be weeks\\nto months long with an individual\u2019s periodized plan lasting for a year or more. Progress is measured across\\nthe different domains of readiness, energy systems, and components of fitness. Adjustments are made to\\navoid plateaus or reversals in fitness due to injury, illness, and unplanned life events. In a periodized plan,\\ngoals change over time from general fitness to a narrower focus on specific task performance.\\n5-3. Sometimes, to help understand a concept like periodization, it helps to describe its opposite. In an\\nunplanned or random training program, the Soldier does whatever he or she feels like. The workout is based\\non intuition, gut feel, tradition, and the time available to train, not the standard for the training. There is no\\nattention to a written, individualized plan that has sequenced, structured targeting of fitness components.\\nPerformance goals center around getting the workout done and are performed with little attention to achieving\\npeak performance. Test proficiency, not task proficiency, drives training choices and the culture of fitness.\\nHard effort tends to dominate the level of exertion. Work-to-rest ratios seldom follow validated approaches.\\nThis approach is common among novices. There is no attempt to assess the needs of each individual Soldier\\nand design a program to meet those needs. This approach leads to varied, non-standardized programming\\nand suboptimal outcomes.\\n5-4. In the sustaining phase, the duration of the Soldier\u2019s physical training plan and training session length\\nshould prepare Soldiers for expected deployment duration and the specific physical tasks of combat. If these\\nare not known or scheduled, then staffs use previous deployment experience to guide planning. In the\\nprevious version of FM 7-22, phases of deployment preparation were divided into six-month segments. These\\ncan still be useful, but more flexible approaches are possible with periodized programming.\\n5-5. Periodized blocks of training can last from several days to several months. They can be progressed\\nover several years. This long-term approach suits the different lengths of Soldier careers. The H2F training\\nphases\u2014initial and sustaining\u2014contain training cycles that last from a few days (microcycles) to several\\nmonths or more (macrocycles). The H2F System facilitates more deliberate, customized, and comprehensive\\napproaches to readiness training for smaller groups and individual Soldiers.\\n5-6. The challenge for commanders is optimizing readiness in spite of the frequent changes in the unit\u2019s\\ntraining schedule, Soldier population, and deployment timeline. See Part Four beginning on page 13-1 for\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 5-1Chapter 5\\ndifferent training scenarios that provide a basis for specific unit and individual training programs. For all\\nthese templates, the performance objective has success in combat.\\n5-7. Across a Soldier\u2019s career span, periodization will guide optimal medical and performance readiness.\\nThis approach to building the Soldier promises to avoid costly, unprogrammed attrition and suboptimal\\nreadiness measures such as undertraining, excessive fatigue, overtraining, illness, and injury.\\nTRAINING CYCLES\\n5-8. Peak performance is attained and maintained by scheduling training through deployments with varying\\nperiods or cycles of maximal and submaximal training. If the Soldier has no scheduled combat deployment,\\nthe cycles can repeat at sub-peak levels to build or sustain very high foundational readiness. These cycles\\ncause changes in the Soldier\u2019s physiological and psychological statuses that lead to improved readiness.\\nTraining schedules are built on the following progressively longer periods of micro-, meso- and macrocycles.\\nMICROCYCLE\\n5-9. The microcycle consists of the detailed daily training structure across two to fourteen days. The days\\nin the microcycle alternate between endurance and strength sessions as well as between training and recovery\\nsessions. Leaders develop these training cycles in conjunction with the operations planning process described\\nin FM 7-0. FM 7-0 uses the operations process conducting training events in a step-by-step approach to help\\ncommanders and other unit leaders train their Soldiers. With a focus on readiness and high levels of training\\nproficiency, FM 7-0 provides the how-to processes of unit training along with practical applications. Leaders\\ncomplete this meticulous planning well prior to the start of training. For subordinate units to develop their\\nown training plans, each headquarters publishes their unit training plan well in advance. This is done not just\\nfor subordinates to plan training, but to allow time for leaders to get certified and to reserve the necessary\\ntraining resources. For training to be effective, the necessary resources must be available at the right point in\\nthe training cycle. Prior to the start of training, detailed planning for each training event must occur. The\\ncompany commander refers back to each event\u2019s training objectives and uses weekly training meetings to\\nassess the training that has occurred and to coordinate activities for future events. There is little difference\\nbetween unit training plan development and building a physical readiness plan.\\nMESOCYCLE\\n5-10. Within the macrocycle, shorter periods of training called mesocycles are the main, medium-sized\\nbuilding blocks of training. The mesocycle lasts from two to six weeks. Each mesocycle aims to establish a\\nnew level of physical readiness\u2014residual fitness\u2014that carries over into the next cycle. As the training is\\naccumulated and absorbed, the Soldier gets fitter. As deployment nears, physical readiness begins to peak\\nand mesocycles are structured to allow accumulated fatigue to dissipate without a loss of residual fitness.\\nThis pre-deployment period of one to two weeks, often known as a taper, keeps the intensity and specificity\\nof exercise high while reducing frequency and duration of training. The physiological response is called\\nsupercompensation.\\nMACROCYCLE\\n5-11. The longest period, usually lasting a year or more, is referred to as a macrocycle. This duration of\\ntraining builds readiness towards a single peak within that time span. A twenty-year Army career would\\ninclude multiple macrocycles. The goal for all Soldiers should be to complete their service in peak condition.\\n5-12. Training periods described in this doctrine feature base period characterized by higher training volume\\nand more training variety. Base periods transition to build periods and then to pre-combat and combat cycles\\nthat feature much less volume and higher intensity. These later periods feature training specific to the\\nessential physical and nonphysical tasks required in the combat mission (see table 5-1).\\n5-2 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Periodization\\nTable 5-1.

Integrated periodization allows the coordinated inclusion of multiple domains of readiness into\\nmultiple phases of a Soldier\u2019s physical training program. This approach allows better management of the\\ntraining load required to optimize performance and control the fatigue, injury risk and misconduct behaviors\\nassociated with high operational tempo and high physical and nonphysical demands (see table 5-2). Integrated\\nperiodization prepares Soldiers in ways similar to high-performance, competitive athletes who also have to\\nsustain peak fitness over athletic careers that span several decades.\\nTable 5-2.

The training period is best developed by identifying the objective (deployment, field training, or test\\nfor example) and working back from that point. The pattern of preparation to reach that goal can then be\\nbroken down into commonly used periods\u2014base, build, peak 1, combat and peak 2, and recovery.\\nFoundational abilities are maintained across these periods while each new period builds on the previous ones.\\nEach domain is integrated in order to reach optimal readiness as the objective nears. For example, nutritional\\nreadiness manages the intake of calories in each period to match the energy expenditure of that period,\\nknowing in advance what the ideal body weight is for optimal performance during the mission.\\n5-15. Strict adherence to the periodized approach should not drive training. The prescription of periods\\nshould not be so rigorously enforced that Soldiers adhere to the schedule above all else.Periodization\\n5-16. Effective H2F performance teams and Soldiers prepare to adapt readiness training in the light of new\\ntraining data and new mission sets. Situation-specific, individualized training accounts for the Soldier\u2019s own\\nstrengths and vulnerabilities. Like an athlete with specific position skills, the individual Soldier may respond\\nto stress by recruiting a range of biological, sociological, and psychological (known as BSP) skills. These\\nsignificantly influence physical training adaptations. If physical and nonphysical stress exceeds these skills,\\nthe Soldier and leaders should anticipate degradation in performance and medical readiness. Responding will\\nrequire the insight of the H2F performance team and the modification of the periodized plan.\\nBASE\\n5-17. This is the period when the basic abilities of endurance, strength, speed, and movement skill are\\nemphasized. This period is the longest of all the periods lasting up to twelve weeks. As most training in this\\nperiod is relatively low intensity, it may be predominate in Soldier populations that do not have any pending\\nprimary missions, deployments, or high-intensity schooling.\\nBUILD\\n5-18. This is the four to eight week period when the abilities from the base period are built upon with higher\\nintensity and increased volume of training. Training effort begins to mimic the primary goal or mission and\\nthe period ends with a simulation of the mission or a test. Leaders might implement a FTX or a practice\\nACFT.\\nPEAK 1\\n5-19. This is the two- to three-week period immediately before a primary mission when leaders deliberately\\nreduce training volume while maintaining or increasing the intensity. This period is designed to create a peak\\nlevel of physiological and psychological readiness while reducing the potential for injuries and stagnation.\\nMaximum effort testing or mission simulation is appropriate during this period. Recovery from the most\\nintense sessions of the training will take longer; therefore, the volume of training may be reduced by 50\\npercent when compared to the later weeks of the build period.\\nCOMBAT AND PEAK 2\\n5-20. This is the two-week to multi-month period of the primary mission or highest intensity training when\\nthe goal is to reach peak levels of readiness and sustain these levels for the duration of the mission or training\\nevent. Arriving fresh and ready to perform requires focused attention on recovery during this period. Training\\nmistakes that lead to illness and injury during this period become more critical since time before the primary\\nmission is reduced and will therefore lead to a degradation in readiness.\\nRECOVERY\\n5-21. This is the period of four to eight weeks when the Soldier is in recovery from the primary mission. It\\nis characterized by low workloads and general adaptation and recovery. This period precedes a return to the\\nbase period and is where recovery occurs that allows the absorption of higher volumes and intensity of\\ntraining later in the macrocycle. In the Soldier lifespan, this would equate to the FSP period as the civilian\\nbegins the physical and mental transition to becoming a Soldier. It would also be the period of recovery after\\na deployment, injury, or illness or following a demanding functional course, such as Ranger School.\\n5-22. Low volume and easy-to-moderate intensity endurance exercise is designed to improve aerobic\\nendurance. Movement skill training is developed through shorter Running Drills and strength training\\nsessions. Total body strength is improved through various resistance training modalities (body weight,\\nmedicine ball, landmine, suspension training, and free weights) that target muscular endurance. Maximal\\neffort testing and training should be delayed until later in the base period to avoid overtraining, illness, and\\ninjury.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 5-5Chapter 5\\nIntegrated Periodization\\nIntegrated periodization allows the coordinated inclusion of multiple domains of\\nreadiness into multiple phases of a Soldier\u2019s H2F program. This approach allows better\\nmanagement of the fatigue and injury risk associated with high operational tempo and\\nhigh physical demands. Each period emphasizes different levels of volume, intensity,\\nfrequency, and time for training. Physical and nonphysical domains of readiness can\\nbe integrated and balanced to train the whole Soldier.\\n5-6 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Chapter 6\\nProgram Design\\nProgram design is completed by H2F performance teams and approved by the unit\u2019s\\ncommand. The design must address the unit\u2019s METL in accordance with the\\ncommander\u2019s guidance. The program must be designed to assist Soldiers with their\\nindividual performance needs. Individualization is the principle that drives\\nprogramming. The training cycle is dictated by an individual needs analysis and by\\nfollow-up assessments of the Soldier\u2019s training objectives, performance level,\\nproximity to combat, and ability to recover.\\nSOLDIER ASSESSMENT\\n6-1. There is no single unified assessment that works for every Soldier. Designing a program will depend\\non the current status of the Soldier and an evaluation of the physical and nonphysical demands of his or her\\njob. At a minimum, the assessment includes movement analysis, physiological analysis, training status,\\nphysical testing and injury screening, nutrition strategies, sleep history, spiritual needs, and mental readiness.\\nCOMPONENTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS\\n6-2. Fitness is often broken down into and measured by commonly accepted parts often labeled\\ncomponents. These components have evolved with advances in exercise science and technology. The H2F\\nSystem\u2019s physical readiness training enhances the components of physical fitness and measures them in the\\nOPAT and ACFT. Higher raw scores due to improved performance on the ACFT give commanders\\ninformation about the absolute capacity of each of their Soldiers\u2019 components of fitness. Leaders who know\\nabout fitness components understand how to regulate and apply training intensity. Soldiers need to train\\nacross all components to meet an infinite range of operational challenges and physiological demands.\\nSTRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS\\n6-3. Structural requirements are the physical and cognitive characteristics that provide the foundation for\\nincreased work capacity. They allow work capacity to increase through regular systematic participation in\\nphysical training that creates a healthy body composition, optimal weight to height ratios, strong bone\\ndensity, good static flexibility and balance, quick reaction time, and perception. In short, Soldiers need these\\nstructural requirements to start and complete more work. Without structural integrity, training cannot\\ncommence or proceed. Table 6-1 on page 6-2 lists structural requirements.\\nPHYSIOLOGICAL CAPACITY\\n6-4. The H2F System is designed to progress a Soldier through regular and progressive training that builds\\nmovement lethality and mental toughness. Soldiers should aspire to achieve their absolute best. Some may\\nachieve world-class performance levels and will inspire others to do the same, but it is the maximal\\nphysiological capacity (strength and endurance) of the whole formation that primarily concerns the\\ncommander, not the exemplary performance of a single Soldier.\\n6-5. A lift that requires movement of 150 pounds is relatively easy for a Soldier who can carry 350\\npounds\u2014his or her absolute workload. This high level of strength allows the Soldier to use relatively less\\neffort to complete the task so that he or she can conserve energy for next effort. That same lift is harder and\\nmuch more intense for someone whose absolute workload is 200 pounds. As relative work capacity\\napproaches a Soldier\u2019s absolute workload, the risk of injury is much higher. Leaders have to differ\u2014\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 6-1Chapter 6\\nindividualize\u2014the training program to improve absolute workload to avoid injury. Commanders who\\nunderstand and apply the concepts of absolute workload and relative workload can better direct their H2F\\npersonnel and align resources to meet their units\u2019 missions.\\nTable 6-1.

Physical readiness includes the following components:\\n\\uf06c Muscular strength.\\n\\uf06c Hypertrophy.\\n\\uf06c Muscular endurance.\\n\\uf06c Aerobic endurance.\\n\\uf06c Anaerobic endurance.\\n\\uf06c Power.\\n6-7. Muscular strength is the amount of force a muscle or a group of muscles can generate. Examples\\ninclude a Flexed Arm Hang for fifteen seconds, one repetition of a Bench Press at maximum weight, or\\nextracting a casualty from a turret. The gold standard for measuring muscular strength is the one repetition\\nmaximum. It is the heaviest weight a Soldier can lift and is best calculated with weight training exercises\\nsuch as the Bench Press, Squat, or Deadlift. High levels of strength that support the mission can certainly be\\nachieved without lifting this amount of weight. In fact, leaders need to use the one repetition maximum\\napproach sparingly. Leaders can use the repetition maximum formula (paragraph 4-25) to calculate one\\nrepetition maximum without complete a one repetition maximum testing. The heaviest weight a Soldier can\\nlift 3 times or 10 times would be a three repetition maximum or ten repetition maximum, respectively.\\n6-8. Hypertrophy is increase in muscle size, which can be achieved through a blending of muscular strength\\nand muscular endurance training. When Soldiers use moderate to heavy loads (65\u201385 percent of one\\nrepetition maximum), a greater number of repetitions and a variety of speeds, they are building muscle mass.\\n6-9. Muscular endurance is the ability of a muscle or muscle group to repetitively perform work for an\\nextended period. Examples include lifting duffel bags onto truck beds, loading 155-millimeter rounds, or\\nperforming Climbing Drill 1. Muscular endurance, in combination with aerobic and anaerobic endurance, is\\nrequired to tolerate carrying progressively heavier loads over greater distances on uneven and steeper terrain\\nand at faster speeds.\\n6-2 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Program Design\\n6-10. Aerobic endurance is the ability to exercise large muscle groups for sustained durations of time longer\\nthan a few minutes. At this level of effort, slow-twitch muscle fibers use oxygen to produce energy while\\nconserving glycogen and glucose through greater metabolism of fat (fatty acids or triglycerides) for energy\\nneeds. Examples include long-distance triathlons, long Foot Marches, patrols, and Unit Formation Runs.\\nAlthough aerobic training is low intensity, high volumes of aerobic training without the proper progression\\nand balance of strength training can cause overtraining. High loads carried during aerobic activity tend to\\nshift the fitness component from aerobic to anaerobic if the same pace is maintained. Soldiers, first the\\nuntrained and then the trained, will begin to slow down when carrying heavier loads. This significantly\\ndecreases the aerobic training effect and increases injury risk.\\n6-11. Anaerobic endurance is the ability to tolerate short bursts of high-intensity activity. At this level of\\neffort, fast-twitch muscles are the greatest contributors. Examples include moving rapidly with a heavy ruck,\\nsprinting, heavy lifting, and combatives. Fuel for this level of intense exercise is primarily derived from\\nglycogen. Anaerobic endurance is finite and therefore associated with complete fatigue. High levels of\\nanaerobic endurance are essential for carrying heavy loads.\\n6-12. Power is the application of strength over time. Muscular power is a result of both the strength and\\nspeed requirements of an activity, which is also described as the rate of work per unit of time. The duration\\nof power training is in seconds, or fraction of seconds, and is characterized by maximal effort. Power\\nworkouts include five to six repetitions of short, explosive work against high levels of resistance followed by\\nlong rest intervals\u2014broad jumps, heavy sled drags, or the Seated Power Throw. Other examples that require\\npower include casualty evacuation or pushing a vehicle stuck in mud.\\nTRAINING SESSIONS\\n6-13. Army training is organized into deliberate actions, or training sessions, that clearly define goals as well\\nas the activities required to accomplish them. H2F programs follow the same logic, incorporating proven\\ncivilian and military training strategies and approaches to both physical and nonphysical domains of H2F.\\nSTRATEGIES\\n6-14. Physical readiness training has evolved over decades based on military and civilian approaches to\\nphysical fitness. This historical record as well as contemporary concepts influence H2F programming. As\\ndescribed in the preceding chapters, H2F programs are designed to meet the readiness goals of the Soldier,\\nthe unit, and by extension the Army. While there are parallels to civilian fitness programs in the H2F System,\\nthe combat specificity and hazards of the profession demand a different approach. This approach is called\\nreadiness. This approach integrates legacy training concepts such as\u2014\\n\\uf06c Low-intensity steady state: once intensity is achieved, the exercise can continue as long as the\\nSoldier can maintain his or her heart rate within a prescribed zone and energy continues to be\\navailable.\\n\\uf06c Pace/tempo training: exercising at lactate threshold, lasting between twenty and thirty minutes.\\nIntermittent pace/tempo is similar to interval training.\\n\\uf06c Circuit training: a combination of resistance and aerobic training activity used for active recovery\\nsessions.\\n\\uf06c Cross training: rotating different exercises throughout the week or rotating different exercise\\nmodes in a training session.\\n\\uf06c Interval training: short periods of high-intensity endurance training separated by longer rest\\nperiods.\\n\\uf06c Push-pull: strength training sessions that alternate between agonist and antagonist muscles\\nexercises such as chest and upper back muscles.\\n\\uf06c Upper-lower: strength training sessions that alternate between upper body and lower body\\nexercises such as Squat and Bench Press.\\n\\uf06c Superset: strength training sessions that work two opposing muscle groups.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 6-3Chapter 6\\nEXERCISE SELECTION\\n6-15. Depending on the phase of training, leaders select exercises based either on the collective needs of the\\nunit or on the needs of the individual Soldier. Exercise selection for strength training should include upper\\nbody pushing, upper body pulling, lower body pulling, lower body pushing, resisted trunk rotation, and\\nloaded carry. Once fundamental movement competency has been achieved in the initial phase through\\ninstruction and training on the Strength Training Circuit, Climbing Drills, and Guerilla Drills, Soldiers will\\nbe properly prepared to progress to heavier free weights in the sustaining phase.\\n6-16. Lifting routines in the H2F System use Squat, Deadlifts, and Bench Press as core exercises with\\nemphasis on precise movement technique over the number of repetitions completed. These free weight core\\n(known as FWC) exercises are programmed to target large muscle groups across multiple joints. These\\nexercises are selected to support specific occupational tasks, especially those that have a high physical\\ndemand. A Free Weight session may include a weight goal for a core lift that is the primary goal of that\\nsession. Soldiers will be properly prepared to progress to heavier load, higher volume and increased intensity\\nfree-weight training in the sustaining phase.\\n6-17. Assistive exercises for resistance training target single muscles or limbs, or small muscle groups that\\nmove single joints. These free weight assistive (known as FWA) exercises complement and prepare for the\\nCore Free Weight sessions. They involve lighter weight than the Soldier\u2019s maximum capacity and a larger\\nnumber of repetitions.\\n6-18. Endurance activities are selected based on the results of aerobic and anaerobic tests. Aerobic tests\\ninclude the Interval Aerobic Run and the 2-Mile Run. Anaerobic activities include agility tests, sprints, and\\nshuttle runs.\\n6-19. There are 38 Drills with a total of 201 exercises in the H2F physical training domain (see table 6-2).\\nModifications in weight, numbers of repetitions, distances and range of motion provide an even greater\\nvariety to accommodate the widest range of Soldier physical readiness. See ATP 7-22.02 for the standards,\\nmodifications, and illustrations for each drill.\\nTRAINING FREQUENCY\\n6-20. Training frequency, the number of training sessions over time, depends on intrinsic factors including\\nage, training experience, and health status of each Soldier. The H2F performance team also considers\\nextrinsic factors. These include time available to train, the planned intensity of the session, occupational\\ntasks, unit mission, the environment, nutrition options, and access to H2F resources. Soldiers can change or\\nmodify some factors such as nutrition and sleep habits. A six-day training schedule with one to two sessions\\nper day that is appropriate for one group of Soldiers may not be appropriate for another. Leaders will have to\\nmodify the schedule to accommodate intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In some cases the factors that are\\nmodifiable will have to change in order to optimize performance.\\n6-21. This doctrine has schedules for Soldiers who can tolerate almost daily training. This frequency is high.\\nTherefore, recovery days are programmed with shorter sessions, lower RPE goals, and less intense drills and\\nexercises. Most of the Army\u2019s conventional force is categorized as able to tolerate moderate levels of physical\\ntasks associated with each MOS. Units with significant or heavy levels of physical tasks associated with\\nMOSs, such as combat arms, use significant or heavy training\u2014higher intensity and higher frequency.\\nEXERCISE ORDER\\n6-22. The order of exercises and activities in a training session focus on properly preparing for the main\\nactivity of the session before performing proper recovery from those activities. The duration of the session\\ndepends on time available to train, the assessment of the Soldier, and the targeted component of fitness. For\\nexample, in a session focused on hypertrophy, Soldiers should try to maintain a 1:1 ratio of preparation and\\nrecovery to the activity. For example, in a one-hour session, preparation and recovery lasts for fifteen minutes\\neach and the main activity lasts for thirty minutes. In a thirty minute session focused on muscular strength,\\nthe preparation for a close-to-maximum effort takes a larger proportion of the session, perhaps twenty\\nminutes before the main activity.

Preparation includes the Preparation Drill, Stability Drill, Military Movement Drill, and other dynamic\\nwarm-up activity that appropriately prepares Soldiers for more intense physical activities. The exercises use\\nbody weight, on-ground and off-ground (jumping) activity, and all three planes of movement. Soldiers\\nconduct exercises at a cadence that permits full range of movement, precise execution, and gradual increase\\nin heart rate and RPE. Paying attention to the timing, intensity, repetitions, and range of motion during\\npreparation is the best way to get ready for the main activities. If the main activity requires specific\\nphysiological demands, then Soldiers should use less intense, assistive movements, and exercises in\\npreparation.\\nACTIVITIES\\n6-24. Physical readiness activities address specific physical training goals across all components of fitness.\\nThey take up most of the time in the session. Weekly schedules alternate days of endurance-focused and\\nstrength-focused activities. To balance both endurance and strength activities, schedules cover at least ten\\ndays. Chapter 14 provides sample multi-week schedules to illustrate the training required for physiological\\nadaptation and periodized training approaches. In the future, platforms provide modifiable physical training\\nschedules that integrate the other domains of readiness. These serve to guide Soldiers remote from H2F\\npersonnel and facilities for ten days or for a single microcyle.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 6-5Chapter 6\\n6-25. When the main activity of the session focuses on strength training, the order of the exercises are\u2014\\n\\uf06c Power exercises before multi-joint exercises.\\n\\uf06c Multi-joint before single joint exercises.\\n\\uf06c Larger muscles before smaller muscles.\\nRECOVERY\\n6-26. Recovery includes all the rest intervals between exercises and the time between exercise sessions.\\nRecovery includes walking after performing running activity and continues with the performance of the\\nstretches in Recovery Drill or the checking for joint stiffness and soreness in preventive maintenance checks\\nand services (PMCS). See ATP 7-22.02 for exercises. The Central Army Registry website provides CIMT\\ndemonstration drills at https://atiam.train.army.mil/catalog/dashboard. The Army Combat Fitness Test\\nwebsite at https://www.army.mil/acft/ provides detailed descriptions and instructional videos for each testing\\nevent.\\nINTENSITY OF TRAINING\\n6-27. Using RPE expediently gauges the intensity of effort in strength and endurance training programs. RPE\\ndescribes how intense the workout should feel as a Soldier completes it. It allows exercise leaders to properly\\ndose intensity across the training session and period. Sticking to the recommended levels of perceived\\nexertion allow effort to be more properly dosed across a training period to avoid overtraining and injury. RPE\\nworks on a 10-point scale with the higher rating representing more intense effort. Table 6-3 includes another\\nexpedient measure of effort that applies in strength training\u2014repetitions in reserve (known as RIR). This\\nnumber represents how many repetitions of a movement or lift a Soldier could perform before having to stop.\\nEasier efforts have higher repetitions in reserve. A one-repetition maximum lift, by definition, should have a\\nrepetitions in reserve of zero\u2014the Soldier should be unable to perform any more repetitions. Prescribed RPE\\nand repetitions in reserve let a Soldier know what effort is required in advance of the workout so that he or\\nshe can better prepare mentally.\\nTable 6-3. Rating of perceived exertion and repetitions in reserve scales\\nRPE Intensity Activity Description RIR\\n1 No effort at all Sitting, lying down or stretching 20\\n2 Extremely little Intermittent walking with little effort 15\\n3 Very easy Sustained walking, light carrying\u2014could maintain the effort all day 10\\n4 Easy Marching, running slowly, light lifting\u2014could maintain the effort for hours 8\\n5 Moderate Running long, ruck marching\u2014breathing heavily as challenge increases 6\\n6 Somewhat Sustained circuit training, running above aerobic endurance\u2014feeling it 4\\nhard\\n7 Hard Short of breath\u2014using short sentences to speak.

Training load, sometimes called training stress, refers to either the weight lifted or the amount of work\\nperformed over time. As load accumulates across a short-term of one session or one day (acute load), the\\nphysical and nonphysical stress on the Soldier builds. This longer-term or chronic load occurs over days or\\nweeks and has to be monitored and adjusted to include all other physical activity in the Soldier\u2019s schedule in\\norder to avoid overload.\\n6-6 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Program Design\\n6-29. If Soldiers use Free Weight exercises, the Strength Training Circuit, Strength Training Machines,\\nLandmine Drills, and Medicine Ball Drills, the amount of load depends on the component of fitness they are\\ntargeting\u2014muscular endurance, muscular strength, hypertrophy, or power. The load for strength training is\\ndescribed as a percentage of the maximum weight a Soldier can lift one time\u2014his or her one repetition\\nmaximum. As a general rule, starting a strengthening program with an emphasis on muscular endurance or\\nhypertrophy will safely develop a Soldier\u2019s foundational strength and allow progression to heavier training\\nloads (see table 6-4).\\nTable 6-4. Training load as a percentage of one repetition maximum for strength training goals\\nGoal Load Repetitions Sets Rest Recovery\\nMuscular endurance 60% 12 or more 2 to 3 Up to 30 secs 24 hours\\nHypertrophy 70\u201385% 6 to12 3 to 6 30 to 90 secs 48 hours\\nMuscular strength 85\u2013100% Up to 6 2 to 6 2 to 5 mins 48 hours\\nPower (repeat efforts) 90% 3 to 5 3 to 5 2 to 5 mins 48 hours\\nPower (single effort) 80% 1 to 2 3 to 5 2 to 5 mins 48 hours\\nmins minutes secs seconds\\n6-30. Assigning rest during sets of strength training exercises depends on the fitness component being\\ntargeted, the percent of maximum weight being lifted (one repetition maximum), the size of the muscle group,\\nthe number of joints and regions of the body being exercised, the period of training, and the current physical\\nreadiness of the Soldier. In general, the heavier the weight, the fewer the repetitions, and the longer the rest\\ninterval. The amount of rest between sets drives the onset of fatigue, and therefore is an important\\nconsideration when performance degrades or when injury occurs. In general, the principle of precision suffers\\nin the presence of fatigue.\\nENDURANCE TRAINING LOAD\\n6-31. The type of endurance training chosen is driven by the targeted type of cardiovascular fitness\\ncomponent. Endurance training load is built aerobically or anaerobically.\\n6-32. Aerobic endurance is built with sustained activity of more than 3 minutes at submaximal levels of\\nintensity. Soldiers can sustain training at this pace for minutes or hours. This type of training recruits slow\\ntwitch or type I muscle fibers and is the primary means of recruiting fat for fuel. Over time, this type of\\nactivity reduces the Soldier\u2019s lean muscle. Because common Soldier tasks and HPDTs require more power\\nand strength than endurance, sustained endurance training should not comprise the majority of a Soldier\u2019s\\nphysical training program.\\n6-33. Anaerobic training recruits type II muscle fibers and uses glucose (sugar) for fuel from 30 seconds to\\nthree minutes. During this time, glycolysis predominates over oxidative phosphorylation. This type of\\ntraining is for very short bouts of effort. Leaders can identify the crossover when a Soldier begins to slow\\ndown after sprinting at maximum effort beyond 150 meters.\\n6-34. The intensity of training heavily impacts the ability to recover. For example, following the Army Ten\\nMiler, an event many Soldiers train intensely for, it may take three to five days to recover before re-restarting\\na training program. Besides RPE, Soldiers can measure the endurance training load by using devices such as\\npower and heart rate monitors. Power monitors often come with road and mountain bicycles and stationary\\nbikes. Newer chest and wrist monitors provide running power. Although appropriate in some special\\nprograms and laboratory settings in the Army, they are not feasible for training large groups. Other biometric\\ndevices or heart rate monitors with wrist or chest-straps provide simple ways to track intensity.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 6-7Chapter 6\\n6-35. When Soldiers monitor heart rate, they can control the level of effort to keep the heart rate at a desired\\nlevel. These levels, or zones, do not tell much about movement skill but can indicate which energy system is\\nbeing utilized. Table 6-5 lists targeted heart rate zones and their associated physical fitness components.\\nTable 6-5. Endurance heart rate zones, fitness components, and levels of effort\\nZone % HRmax Fitness Component Level of % of Total Distance /\\nEffort Endurance Training Time\\n5 90\u2013100 Anaerobic explosive speed Maximum 10 200 m / 0:30\\n4 80\u201390 Anaerobic endurance Very Hard 30 400 m / 1:15\\n3 70\u201380 Aerobic endurance Hard 10 800 m / 3:45\\n2 60\u201370 Aerobic endurance Moderate 40 1MR / 7:30\\n1 50\u201360 Active recovery Easy 10 2MR / 20:00\\nHRmax heart rate maximum m meter MR mile run\\n6-36. Resting heart rate monitoring can be a good way to measure recovery period immediately after a\\nworkout and again the following morning. Consistent monitoring upon waking over several months is an\\neasy way for a Soldier to know his or her state of recovery each day. Resting heart rate should be lower over\\ntime in well-trained Soldiers. Daily spikes above the normal range may be an indicator of overtraining or of\\nthe need to reduce intensity of the next session. Poor sleep, nutrition, hydration, and stress control will all\\nnegatively impact the daily results, causing the resting heart rate to increase.\\n6-37. Heart rate monitoring during endurance exercise depends not only on the measurement device, but also\\non knowing the target heart rate for the workout and unit training plan. Using the Karvonen formula, which\\nis based on predicted maximum heart rate, a zone of 60\u201380 percent effort in a 30-year-old Soldier is between\\n138 to 164 bpm (see table 6-6). As with the monitoring of the resting heart rate, the best results often come\\nfrom consistent self-monitoring and repeated testing over many months and years.\\nTable 6-6. Target heart rates using maximal heart rate formulas\\n30 year old Soldier with a RHR of 60 beats per minute has a target heart rate of\\n60% to 80% of age-predicted MHR\\nKarvonen Formula\\n220 - age - RHR = 220 - 30 - 60 = 130\\nMHR = 130 bpm\\n60\u201380% of 130 = 138 to 164 bpm\\nTarget is 151 bpm\\nbpm beats per minute MHR maximum heart rate RHR resting heart rate\\nProgram Design\\nProgram design is completed by holistic health and fitness (H2F) performance\\nreadiness experts and approved by the unit\u2019s command. The design must address the\\nunit\u2019s mission-essential task list (METL) in accordance with the commander\u2019s\\nguidance. The program must assist Soldiers with their individual needs.\\nIndividualization is the principle that drives programming. The training cycle is dictated\\nby initial needs analysis and follow-up assessments of a Soldier\u2019s level of development,\\nability to recover and training objectives.\\n6-8 FM 7-22 1 October 2020PART THREE\\nBuild\\nThis part describes the details of each of the five domains used to build the physical\\nand nonphysical training programs of H2F. The domains are physical readiness,\\nnutritional readiness, mental readiness, spiritual readiness, and sleep readiness. It\\nalso discusses the special conditioning requirements.\\nChapter 7\\nPhysical Readiness\\nPhysical readiness is a critical component of Soldier readiness, unit readiness, and\\nArmy readiness. Effective Soldiers can overcome ever-changing and complex\\nchallenges in both strategic and operational environments. They must possess the\\nphysical and nonphysical capabilities to fight and win in multi-domain operations. The\\nchapter describes the principles of physical readiness, as well as the fundamentals of\\nmovement for the execution of Army physical training. Ruck marching, running and\\nswimming serve as the foundations of physical readiness and enable Soldiers to\\nperform their occupational tasks and endure the physical demands of combat.\\nPRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL READINESS\\n7-1. The principles of physical readiness training are precision, progression, and integration. Effective\\nSoldiers can precisely execute the program\u2019s exercises and drills. These Soldiers progress from physical\\nproficiency in WTBD to being able to integrate those skills into tasks required for their MOSs and combat.\\nPRECISION\\n7-2. Precise movement depends on having the structural capabilities, proper flexibility, tolerance of extra\\nweight, body composition, and the connection of the brain to muscles\u2014motor patterns\u2014that allow Soldiers\\nto learn the standard and perceive the difference between correct and incorrect techniques. The quality of the\\nmovement is as important as the weight lifted, repetitions performed, or speed of the movement. Movement\\nskill develops through the repeated execution and deliberate practice of foundational drills and exercises.\\nRehearsal using mental imagery can assist in refining precise movement patterns without the cost of physical\\nexertion. The principle of precision ensures the development of perception and awareness of the body\u2019s\\nposition in space\u2014kinesthesia\u2014to improve training, testing, and battlefield performance. See ATP 7-22.01\\nfor H2F testing, and ATP 7-22.02 for drills and exercises.\\nPROGRESSION\\n7-3. Progression refers to the proper dose of frequency, intensity, duration, and type of exercise required to\\noverload the body without causing overtraining, plateauing, or reversal of fitness. The goal is to develop\\nphysical capacity to support the mastery of occupational and combat-specific tasks. Task analysis includes\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 7-1Chapter 7\\nthe physiological demands of the task and potential performance and injury issues the Soldier might have.\\nProper progression of the weight, repetitions, speed, and variety of exercises builds from the initial phase to\\nsustaining phase. Initial phase training creates foundational fitness that Soldiers use to safely progress from\\nthe sustaining phase to higher levels of operational physical capacity. It is important to remember that all\\nmovement skill requires consistent revisiting of the basics before and after progressing to higher levels.\\nINTEGRATION\\n7-4. The integration principle focuses on tasks and drills Soldiers perform that enable them to fight and\\nwin. The Army trains Soldiers and units to fight and win in combat using a specific list of WTBD. Warrior\\ntasks are a collection of individual skills linked to a Soldier\u2019s ability to shoot, move, communicate, survive,\\nand protect and treat. Examples include weapons training, tactical communications, urban operations, and\\nfirst aid. Battle drills are group skills designed to teach a unit to react and survive in common combat\\nsituations. WTBD establish a minimum standard for all Soldiers independent of age, sex, and MOS. All\\ncommanders ensure that their Soldiers can execute all WTBD. Soldiers demonstrate this ability by regularly\\ntraining and testing on the tasks to ensure they have been integrated into the Soldiers\u2019 skill sets.\\n7-5. Soldiers following this doctrine will become more physically fit, but it is not a prescription for\\nrecreational fitness or for fitness for fitness\u2019 sake. This fitness aims to develop physical capacity to support\\nthe mastery of MOS and combat-specific tasks. Once Soldiers reach high foundational readiness standards\\nin the initial phase, they continue to build foundational fitness and METL-specific physical capabilities.\\n7-6. This doctrine integrates physical training with nonphysical training. Leaders consider the nonphysical\\ndomains integrating with the physical training plan. Training goals need to account for Soldiers\u2019 ability to\\nphysically and mentally perform in extreme environments of heat, cold, and humidity, and while carrying\\nheavy personal protective equipment. Recovery between training sessions must also be trained, measured,\\nand scheduled. Leaders also manage obstacles to goal achievement. For example, a unit will not gain much\\nfrom having 24-hour access to a gym if an assessment of the unit\u2019s sleep readiness shows an average of below\\nsix hours per night. Similarly, if a unit readiness measure is a reduction in ABCP enrollees, then unhealthy\\nfast food options in the unit\u2019s life support area contradicts that goal.\\n7-7. H2F drills and exercises balance different energy systems and components of fitness for each Soldier.\\nThat Soldier\u2019s movement skill and physical capacity create the unit\u2019s ability to deliver force. The Soldier\u2019s\\ngoal for readiness will include the demands of the MOS, the unit\u2019s METL, and the likely environmental,\\nphysical, and nonphysical challenges of the unit\u2019s deployment mission. The physical activities of combat\\nmay include more than those listed in WTBD and must be trained for. Examples include repeated forcible\\nentries, quick pursuits, close combat, sustained mountain patrolling, and sustained load carriage.\\n7-8. A fully integrated Soldier can complete 16-mile ruck marches, load gun turrets, replace large tires,\\nextract and evacuate casualties, move over and around obstacles, react to man-to-man contact, and load\\n155-millimeter rounds onto a bustle rack. Table 7-1 illustrates the integration of H2F physical training and\\ntest events into critical combat tasks. The training activity and the test events are reverse-engineered from\\nthe combat tasks. Therefore, H2F training takes care of those test events as well.\\n7-2 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Physical Readiness\\nTable 7-1.

This section illustrates how to develop a program to train for the occupational task of ruck marching.\\nA combat arms unit preparing for dismounted operations during an upcoming deployment uses the following\\nprinciples and template to develop a training approach. The four-week ruck marching program outlined in\\ntable 7-2 and table 7-3 uses the following considerations to develop the first mesocycle in a longer training\\nschedule:\\n\\uf06c Once per week progressive ruck march: progress one factor each week of either weight of the load,\\ndistance of the march, speed of the march, gradient of the terrain or roughness of the terrain.\\n\\uf06c Loads above 30 percent of body weight should be increased with caution.\\n\\uf06c Do not do long marches, endurance runs, or heavy leg strength workouts on consecutive days.\\n\\uf06c Strength training performed with free weights and strength training machines (STMs) at least three\\ndays per week, moving from high repetitions (12+) with less weight (muscular endurance) and\\nRPE of 6\u20137 to lower repetitions (3\u20136 reps) with heavier weight and RPE of 8 and working up to 3\\nsets per core exercise (Bench, Deadlift, Squat) and complementary exercises (for example\\nOverhead Push Press, Lat Pull Downs, Leg Press).\\n\\uf06c Aerobic endurance training with progressive increases in distance (running 20-30 minutes based\\non RPE, pace, and or heart rate) and running skill drills, along with interval training with\\nprogressive decreases in rest (60:120s progressing to 30:60s; or 2 x 300-meter shuttle run [known\\nas 300SR] in 3 minutes progressing to 4 x 300-meter shuttle run in 1 minute).\\n\\uf06c Adhere precisely to pace, effort, and movement goals with each road march and across each\\nsession.\\n\\uf06c Progressively integrate terrain, loads, and distances that replicate conditions likely to be\\nencountered in combat environments.

Running instruction has challenged the U.S. Army for the last decade. It has been one of the most\\ncommon concerns of Soldiers leaving IMT. Numerous individual variations in running skill exist, however,\\nsome common principles can help Soldiers run better and reduce injuries. Various running instructional\\nmodels and programs exist. This publication and ATP 7-22.02 use the Pose Method\u00ae as a method for the\\nrunning skill program and drills. Scientific literature does not explicitly support a single running style that is\\noptimal for all individuals. Many other running technique instructional methods exist through commercial\\norganizations and sanctioned governing bodies. Instructors can use other techniques they deem more suitable\\nfor the population they are instructing.\\n7-11. Soldiers who need foundational running skill or who want to improve their running performance may\\nbenefit from standardized drills that develop running skill. Soldiers understand that standards and skill\\ndevelopment are key factors in the optimal performance of any physical readiness activity and any Soldier\\ntask. Running is no different. The amount and variety of running activity are controlled in the H2F System\\nto provide time to improve running and other movement skills, and to prevent misuse injuries that arise from\\npoor skill combined with too much run frequency and intensity. A balanced approach applies to running just\\nas it does to the other skills across the H2F System. Commanders who control the amount of running can\\nspend more time developing strength and the other skills that further enhance readiness domains. Figure 7-1\\ndepicts the discrete elements of running skill: the dominant position/pose, fall and pull.\\nFigure 7-1. Running skill\u2014the dominant position/ pose, fall, pull\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 7-5Chapter 7\\n7-12. In the H2F performance team, MFTs develop training plans and lead physical training sessions that\\nincorporate Running Drills. MFTs teach the running skill in the classroom as well as on the training field.\\nTHE RUNNING PARADIGM\\n7-13. Paragraphs 7-14 through 7-25 describe the paradigm behind the Running Drills. A paradigm describes\\na way of thinking about an issue or problem. It provides a useful way to analyze and understand a problem\\nand usually includes common language or terms. The running skill paradigm described in figure 7-2 supports\\nthe concept that leaders can teach running skill as a technique using drills and exercises.\\nFigure 7-2. The running skill paradigm\\n7-14. Just like any skill position in a team or individual sport (swimming, baseball, soccer, cycling), any lift\\nin the gym, Soldiers develop technique\u2014the applied skill of the movement\u2014over time by purposeful and\\ndeliberate practice. Movement skills such as switching from rifle to pistol or close quarters combat requires\\na skilled coach as well as repeated practice. High-level skill in running is no different. Running drills and\\nexercises aim to progressively build and correct running skill. They build the physical capacity and mental\\nawareness of the position of the body while running.\\n7-15. Gravity is the arbiter of movement. Although not seen, Soldiers can see and feel its effects. They stay\\nat rest because of it and lose balance because of it. All forces on Earth are derivatives of gravity. As a force\\nof nature, it cannot be overcome. Gravity is the one force that allows Soldiers to go from standing still to\\nmoving forward. As a pencil falls from a desk, a rocket arcs towards its target, and a Soldier trips through\\nthe Sprint-Drag-Carry, gravity is predominant.\\n7-16. During running, as the body moves, it rotates around its point of support on the ground\u2014where the\\nfoot meets the ground. The angle between the body starting position as the foot contacts the ground and the\\nnew angle of the body as the foot leaves the ground can be measured. The greater the angle, the greater the\\nspeed of the movement. Using classical geometry and mechanics, this angular velocity can be translated into\\nforward or linear velocity in two equations. In the first, v = r\u03c9 where v is linear velocity, r is the radius of\\nrotation (leg length), and \u03c9 is the angular velocity of a given rotation. In the second equation,\\n\ud835\udf03\\n\ud835\udf14=\\n\ud835\udc61\\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle of deviation of the body from the vertical and t is the time of passing through that angle.\\n7-17. Therefore, v = r \u03b8/t. The Soldier\u2019s running speed depends on his or her angle of fall\u2014the greater the\\nangle, the greater the speed. Keeping the center of mass over and then moving it ahead of the base of support\\nrequires maintaining the dominant running position, which requires muscles to be strong enough to maintain\\nthe body\u2019s position during the fall. Changing support from one foot to the other requires an active pull of the\\nfoot from the ground to increase the speed of movement through the fall angle. Running Drills increase the\\nspecific strength required to do this. If the fall angle is greater, so will be the acceleration and subsequent\\nspeed of the body over the ground. Acceleration is a = g \u2219 sin \u03b8, where g is gravity, and sin is sine (ratio of\\nthe shortest to the longest sides of the angle). A larger angle generates an increase in acceleration. Figure 7-3\\nillustrates the body\u2019s translation of angular velocity into horizontal velocity.\\n7-6 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Physical Readiness\\nFigure 7-3. Translation of angular velocity of the body into horizontal velocity\\n7-18. In the case of human movement, gravity has to be worked with. When standing still, muscles support\\nbody weight, maintain a state of rest, and balance under the influence of the downward force of gravity. The\\nmuscle works to maintain the balanced position or to reposition the body to be able to change support. Unless\\nan external force acts upon the body\u2019s weight or muscles reposition that weight, the body remains at rest. If\\nSoldiers lose balance, either because muscles have relaxed or an external force acted upon them, they begin\\nto fall\u2014they move. Classical mechanics and geometry give a mathematical explanation of how this\\nmovement happens. Figure 7-4 describes the effect of gravity on movement.\\nFigure 7-4. A schematic demonstrating gravity\u2019s influence on movement\\n7-19. Like the rocket example, our movement is initially in the horizontal plane\u2014forward\u2014via gravitational\\ntorque. The body becomes a lever as its mass pivots around the base of support\u2014the foot. The pivot ends as\\nthe toes are pulled from the ground. If the front of the foot is used as the base of support throughout the\\nduration of contact with the ground, less time will be spent pivoting on the ground, allowing an earlier pull.\\nThe point is not to simply land on a specific part of the foot, the point is to reach a position to continue\\nmoving forward as efficiently as possible. The movement forward\u2014the fall\u2014can conclude only when the\\nfoot no longer supports the body\u2019s weight. Falling over can be prevented only by rapidly reestablishing\\nbalance\u2014a new base to support the body\u2019s weight. To move forward from this new base of support, the body\\nmust reach a position where it can pull the foot from the ground to fall again. Repeating this action at higher\\nfrequencies increases speed.\\n7-20. Similar to the command \u201cSTARTING POSITION, MOVE,\u201d in Conditioning Drills, or the predominant\\nposes taught in ballet and dance, or ready positions in martial arts, Soldiers can master the dominant running\\nposition, or pose, through drills and exercises. They can also master the action required to move quickly in\\nand out of this position. The action of the hamstring as it contracts to pull the support foot from the ground\\nand under the hip, positions the body for the next fall. The three words\u2014pose, fall, pull\u2014concisely describe\\nthe \u201chow\u201d of \u201chow to run.\u201d These are the essential elements of running skill. They form a standard against\\nwhich a Soldier\u2019s running skill can be measured.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 7-7Chapter 7\\nRunning\\nRunning is a recurring change of support from one foot to the other.\\nThis change begins as the runner\u2019s center of mass falls forward of the support foot that\\nthe runner then pulls from the ground.\\nThe foot is pulled up toward the hip by the hamstring muscles while the opposite foot\\nmoves to the ground to provide a new support.\\nAs the pulled leg passes the support leg, the body reaches a new position from where\\nit can continue acceleration.\\nRUNNING MEASUREMENT\\n7-21. Measurement of this standard using readily available video feedback does not take much time. The\\nH2F performance team can quickly analyze a Soldier\u2019s running stride to show the Soldier his or her deviation\\nfrom the standard. This visual and verbal feedback, like any coaching, increases the Soldier\u2019s perception of\\nhow he or she is running. Leaders can prescribe drills and exercises for the Soldier based on specific\\ndeviations from the standard. Such drills and exercises reduce excess strain on the body and increase running\\nspeed and distance (see figure 7-5).\\nFigure 7-5. The anatomy of a running stride\\n7-22. Running Drills may be performed collectively or individually. Table 7-4 summarizes Running Drills\\nused to develop running skill. ATP 7-22.02 discusses and illustrates the purpose and execution of all seven\\nRunning Drills in detail. Soldiers perform the drills at least once per week to develop proper form. As with\\nall physical training exercises, consistent adherence to precise execution provides optimal results.\\n7-23. After conducting a block of instruction, commanders who want to progress running skills should\\nschedule Running Drills two times per week for fifteen to twenty minutes during endurance activities.\\nRunning Drills should precede or follow running activities. Running Drill 1 is used to increase awareness of\\nimproper running form. Leaders do not have to use Running Drills in order. They may be prescribed to\\naddress individual and unit deficits in running skill.\\n7-24. The Soldier\u2019s perception of any movement\u2014whether it be running, weightlifting, or shooting\u2014is\\ndeveloped through physical repetition and attention to form. Repetition improves skill by connecting the\\nbrain to the body part. By asking questions about perception, performance experts, MFTs, and unit leaders\\npromote faster adoption of improved skill.\\n7-8 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Physical Readiness\\nTable 7-4.

H2F physical readiness training builds skills that help Soldiers survive in water. Water survival skills\\nare critical Soldier combat tasks. Commanders can incorporate these skills into physical training schedules,\\nor treated as special training events and programmed accordingly. The inclusion of pool or aquatics training\\nin special conditioning requires that commanders know whether their Soldiers can swim and have completed\\ndrown-proofing. Paragraphs 7-26 through 7-47 discuss Army Water Survival Training (AWST). See\\nATP 7-22.01 for more details.\\n7-26. Soldiers who successfully complete AWST identifies possess the requisite swimming skills to\\ncomplete more advanced waterborne training and testing. When AWST is conducted to standard, Soldier\\nsafety is ensured while performance is enhanced. AWST builds Soldier confidence prior to special\\nconditioning pool workouts and increases survivability in operations in and around water.\\n7-27. Two levels of classification in the AWST program inform the commander the water survivability levels\\nof his or her Soldiers: basic survival swimmer (known as BSS) and combat survival swimmer (known as\\nCSS). All Soldiers complete combat survival swimmer annually. Qualification at the combat survival\\nswimmer level is necessary only for units that anticipate extensive operations in and around water. These\\nunits conduct operations over the shore, maritime transportation, and the Army diver program.\\n7-28. The Combat Water Survival Test (CWST) accurately records a Soldier\u2019s ability to safely function in a\\nwater environment. The CWST certifies Soldiers who intend to lead AWST and for other trainers in the H2F\\nSystem. AWST trainers must be certified annually in the CWST. Soldiers who wish to maintain the validation\\nmust re-certify on the CWST every two years.\\nSAFETY\\n7-29. Safety is the first concern when training Soldiers in and around water. Unit standard operating\\nprocedures for swim instruction, aquatic rehabilitation, and water survival training must be developed to\\nensure safe and effective training. SOPs describe the training area, uniform, personal equipment, formation,\\nleadership, commands, and safety. Leaders use, review, and rehearse written safety and emergency action\\nplans prior to conducting training. AWST trainers and assistant instructors perform risk management\\nfollowing installation policy and DA Pam 385-30. Qualified lifeguards attend and have standard sets of pool\\nsafety and rescue equipment on hand at all times. A standard set of equipment consists of\u2014\\n\\uf06c Shepherd\u2019s crook and reaching poles.\\n\\uf06c Heaving line.\\n\\uf06c Ring buoy with rope.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 7-9Chapter 7\\n\\uf06c Back board with tie down straps and cervical collar.\\n\\uf06c Whistles.\\n\\uf06c First aid kit.\\n\\uf06c Automatic electronic defibrillator (known as AED).\\n7-30. Lifeguards must have a current American Red Cross Lifeguard Training certificate and must be\\ncertified in first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (known as CPR). Lead and assistant instructors should\\nbe strong swimmers. Ideally all instructors have cardiopulmonary resuscitation training and Water Safety\\nInstructor certificates and have passed the CWST.\\n7-31. Non-swimmers require extra training time. Those who do not self-declare as non-swimmers should be\\ngiven extra swim training if they fail the two minute buoyancy test\u2014treading water and sculling for two\\nminutes in ACUs and boots without going underwater or touching the bottom of the pool. Extra swim training\\ntime provides Soldiers training to perform the two strokes necessary to pass the basic survival swimmer\u2014\\nthe sidestroke and breaststroke.\\nBASIC SURVIVAL SWIMMER\\n7-32. Soldiers must successfully complete the following three training tasks to for basic survival swimmer.\\nSoldiers will wear ACUs, boots, and improved outer tactical vest (IOTV) without plates. Soldiers will carry\\nan M16 or M4 series training aid for tasks 2 and 3:\\n\\uf06c Task 1: Trouser inflation and float.\\n\\uf06c Task 2: Bob and travel.\\n\\uf06c Task 3: Two-Stroke test (sidestroke and breaststroke).\\nTASK 1: TROUSER INFLATION AND FLOAT\\n7-33. Task 1, trouser inflation and float, consists of the following four steps:\\n\\uf06c Perform stride entry by leaping off the edge of the pool deck into the water with the trunk leaning\\nforward, the head up, the legs spread in a stride position (one forward, the other back), and the\\narms extended sideward (palms facing downward). Immediately upon entry, the legs move\\ntogether and the arms move vigorously downward slapping the water upon entry. This technique\\nkeeps the head above water and allows the Soldier to maintain visibility.\\n\\uf06c Use the emergency pull strap on the IOTV to release it, allowing the parts IOTV to fall to the\\nbottom of the pool. Soldiers collect the IOTV after completing Task 3.\\n\\uf06c Perform a hanging float and remove one boot at a time. Place the first boot under an arm while\\nuntying the other boot. Tie the laces together and put the boots around the neck, resting each boot\\non each side of the chest. Remove trousers, button the fly, and tie-off each trouser leg individually\\nusing an overhand knot.\\n\\uf06c Inflate the trousers using the sling or splash method. Once the trousers are inflated, gather-in the\\nwaist band and twist to seal the air inside the trousers. While grasping the twisted waist band,\\nclimb in between the trouser legs and place one leg under each arm. Float for two minutes.\\nSling Method\\n7-34. The sling method consists of the following steps:\\n\\uf06c Place the trousers on top of the water as if they are to be put on.\\n\\uf06c Grasp the waistband, forming a circular opening on the surface of the water.\\n\\uf06c Maintaining hold of the waistband, cross the right arm over the left, then rotate the trousers counter\\nclockwise above and behind the head.\\n\\uf06c Maintain the circular opening of the waistband with both hands.\\n\\uf06c Perform a large scissor kick while forcibly extending the arms overhead.\\n\\uf06c Sling the trousers quickly forward and downward, trapping air under the water.\\n\\uf06c Immediately gather in the waistband to maintain inflation of each trouser leg.\\n7-10 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Physical Readiness\\n\\uf06c Continue to hold the waistband together with one hand, while bringing the opposite arm around\\nand over the same side trouser leg.\\n\\uf06c Change hands continuing to hold the waistband together with the other hand while bringing the\\nopposite arm around and over the other trouser leg.\\nSplash Method\\n7-35. The splash method consists of the following steps:\\n\\uf06c Place trousers in front and hold the waistband open at the fly with one hand.\\n\\uf06c While using the scissors of frog kick to stay afloat, splash water and air toward the waistband\\nopening with a downward motion of the hand, stopping the stroke at the opening.\\n\\uf06c Immediately gather in the waistband to maintain inflation of each trouser leg.\\n\\uf06c Continue to hold the waistband together with one hand, while bringing the opposite arm around\\nand over the same side trouser leg.\\n\\uf06c Change hands while continuing to hold the waistband together with the other hand, bringing the\\nopposite arm around and over the other trouser leg.\\nTASK 2: BOB AND TRAVEL\\n7-36. Task 2, bob and travel, consists of the following steps:\\n\\uf06c Sling weapon over the right shoulder, grasping the sling close to the sling clamp with the left hand\\nat the chest and the weapon butt plate with the right hand. The weapon is then pulled tight to the\\nback. Stand with toes on the edge of the pool deck and face toward the water. Step off the edge of\\nthe pool deck into the water, with the knees slightly flexed to absorb the impact upon hitting the\\nbottom of the pool. Submerge to the bottom of the pool, slowly exhaling air through the nose while\\nmaintaining control of the weapon. Place the weapon on the pool floor.\\n\\uf06c Assume a squatting position and push off the bottom of the pool with both feet, extending the arms\\noverhead and hands together, traveling forward at a 45-degree angle toward the surface (travel).\\nUpon reaching the surface, take a full breath and rotate the hips forward, drawing the knees toward\\nthe chest (bob). Re-submerge to the bottom of the pool by straightening the legs and bringing the\\narms forcefully overhead with the palms turned inward, slowly exhaling air through the nose.\\nRepeat the travel action, continuing to bob and travel for fifteen meters.\\nTASK 3: TWO-STROKE TEST\\n7-37. When performed correctly, the sidestroke and breaststroke enable the Soldier to move through the\\nwater quickly and efficiently. The sidestroke is one of the most efficient strokes because it allows the Soldier\\nthe ability to rest on top of the water. It is also the stroke used in the Collar Tow. The breaststroke is the most\\nuseful stroke for military swimming. It is efficient when swimming through debris and in full clothing and\\ngear, and it provides good visibility.\\n7-38. Soldiers enter the water at the deep end of the pool using the stride entry. They swim for the length of\\nthe pool or 25 meters using the sidestroke. Soldiers exit the shallow end of the pool and walk back to the\\ndeep end starting point. They then re-enter the water at the deep end using the stride entry, and swim the\\nlength of the pool performing the breaststroke. Soldiers exit the shallow end of the pool.\\nCOMBAT SURVIVAL SWIMMER\\n7-39. Soldiers must successfully complete the following four tasks to become classified as combat survival\\nswimmers. Uniform is ACUs, boots, and IOTV without plates. Soldiers carry an M16 or M4 series training\\naid for all four tasks:\\n\\uf06c Task 1: Equipment removal.\\n\\uf06c Task 2: Collar tow.\\n\\uf06c Task 3: 15 Meter underwater swim.\\n\\uf06c Task 4: 3 Meter drop and pool exit.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 7-11Chapter 7\\n7-40. AWST leaders select a location on the deep end of the pool where the water is a minimum of nine feet\\ndeep. Soldiers wear ACUs with boots, IOTV, and M16 or M4 training aid slung over their back. A safety\\nline may be attached to the Soldier and controlled by the AWST leader or assistant instructor. A shepherd\u2019s\\ncrook will also be available. If at any time the Soldier shows signs of undue fear, stress, panic, or fatigue, the\\nAWST leader or assistant instructor will use the safety line or crook to pull the Soldier from the water.\\nTASK 1: EQUIPMENT REMOVAL\\n7-41. Soldiers will practice equipment removal while on the deck prior to entering the water using the\\nfollowing steps:\\n\\uf06c The Soldier moves to starting point at the deep end of the pool. The Soldier moves to the entry\\nline with his or her back facing the water and slings the weapon over the left shoulder, grasping\\nthe sling close to the sling clamp with the right hand at the chest and the weapon butt plate with\\nthe left hand. The Soldier pulls the weapon tight to the back.\\n\\uf06c The Soldier stands with heels on the edge of the pool deck and back toward the water. He or she\\nthen performs a rear water entry bending forward slightly at the waist, transferring body weight to\\nthe heels, and falling rearward into the water while maintaining control of the slung weapon. He\\nor she then breaks the water with the rear of the thighs and buttocks.\\n\\uf06c After performing the rear entry, the Soldier submerges to the bottom of the pool while exhaling\\nthrough the nose and mouth. Upon reaching the bottom of the pool, the Soldier removes his or her\\nweapon from its slung position and places it on the bottom of the pool.\\n\\uf06c The Soldier then removes the IOTV and places it on the bottom of the pool. The Soldier surfaces\\nand continues to swim any stroke to the side of the pool and exit. If the Soldier shows signs of\\npanic, the assistant instructor pulls the Soldier to the side of the pool using the safety line or\\nshepherd\u2019s crook.\\nTASK 2: COLLAR TOW\\n7-42. The collar tow is used to help swimmers who are tired, but not struggling. For this task, one Soldier\\nacts as rescuer while a partner acts as victim. The Soldiers then reverse roles using the following steps:\\n\\uf06c AWST leaders select a location on the deep end of the pool where the water is a minimum of nine\\nfeet deep. The Soldiers perform this task wearing ACU, boots, IOTV, and M16 or M4 training aid\\nslung over the back. Soldiers are paired with a partner. Prior to entering the water, Soldiers practice\\na dry run of the event including the stroke mechanics for the sidestroke while on the pool deck.\\n\\uf06c The rescuer slings weapon over the left shoulder, grasping the sling close to the sling clamp with\\nthe right hand at the chest and the weapon butt plate with the left hand. The Soldier pulls the\\nweapon tight to the back. The rescuer stands with toes on the edge of the pool deck while facing\\ntoward the water. The rescuer performs stride entry by stepping off the pool deck into the water\\nwith trunk leaning forward, head up, legs spread in a stride position (one forward, the other back),\\nand weapon slung across the back. Immediately upon entry, the rescuer moves legs together. This\\ntechnique keeps the head above water and allows the rescuer to maintain visibility. The rescuer\\nwill stabilize buoyancy, roll onto left side, and breaststroke toward the victim.\\n\\uf06c The rescuer grabs the tired swimmer\u2019s collar at the back of the neck and pulls him or her to a\\nhorizontal position on his or her back. The rescuer maintains hold of the victim\u2019s collar, keeping\\nhis or her arm fully extended. The rescuer uses a modified sidestroke while towing, swimming on\\nthe side that feels most natural, using a sidearm pull and scissor kick. The Soldier should aim to\\nmaster the stroke on both sides.\\n\\uf06c Following the sidestroke sequence, rescuers exit the pool in the deep end by placing their rifle on\\nthe deck while maintaining contact with the victim on the side of the pool. This is best\\naccomplished by securing one or both arms of the tired swimmer against the pool deck while\\nexiting the pool. Once on the pool deck, the rescuer squats and grasps the tired swimmer\u2019s IOTV\\nand rotates him or her so their back is against the side of the pool. The rescuer simultaneously\\nstands up from the squat position and lays the tired swimmer onto the pool deck.\\n7-12 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Physical Readiness\\nTASK 3: UNDERWATER SWIM\\n7-43. The underwater swim measures Soldiers\u2019 confidence and ability to enter the water, submerge to the\\nbottom of the pool, successfully swim fifteen meters underwater with their equipment, surface, and exit the\\npool. They use the following steps:\\n\\uf06c AWST leaders select a location on the deep end of the pool where the water is a minimum of nine\\nfeet deep. The Soldier performs this task wearing ACUs, boots, IOTV, and M16 or M4 training\\naid slung over the back. Prior to entering the water, Soldiers should practice breaststroke\\nmechanics while on the pool deck.\\n\\uf06c The Soldier slings weapon over the left shoulder, grasping the sling close to the sling clamp with\\nthe right hand at the chest and the weapon butt plate with the left hand. The Soldier pulls the\\nweapon tight to the back. The Soldier stands with heels on the edge of the pool deck and back\\ntoward the water.\\n\\uf06c The Soldier performs a rear water entry by bending forward at the waist, transferring body weight\\nto the heels, and falling rearward into the water while maintaining control of the slung weapon.\\nThe Soldier breaks the water with the rear of the thighs and buttocks. The Soldier submerges to\\nthe bottom of the pool and slowly exhales air through the mouth and nose.\\n\\uf06c The Soldier pushes off the bottom of the pool with both feet, bobs to the surface, and grasps the\\nedge of the pool deck. Upon command of the AWST leader, the Soldier rotates facing the pool,\\ntakes a full breath, and drops under the surface of the water. Immediately pushes off the wall and\\nbegins the underwater swim with arm and leg movements used in the breaststroke.\\n\\uf06c The Soldier remembers to slowly exhale air through the mouth and nose while underwater\\nswimming to the opposite side of the pool. Upon reaching the opposite pool wall, the Soldier\\nsurfaces and performs a pool exit.\\nTASK 4: 3-METER DROP AND POOL EXIT\\n7-44. The 3-meter drop with rifle and equipment measures a Soldier\u2019s ability to enter the water, swim to the\\nside of the pool, and exit with weapon and equipment.\\n7-45. AWST leaders select a location on the side of the pool where the water is a minimum of nine feet deep.\\nThe Soldier performs this task wearing ACUs, boots, IOTV, and M16 or M4 training aid. A shepherd\u2019s crook\\nor safety line will be attached to Soldier and controlled by AWST leader or assistant instructor. If the Soldier\\nshows signs of undue fear, stress, panic, or fatigue, the AWST leader or assistant instructor will use the safety\\nline or crook to pull the Soldier from the water.\\n7-46. The Soldier performs a stride entry by stepping off the 3-meter diving board or platform into the water\\nwith the trunk leaning forward, the head up, the legs spread in a stride position (one forward, the other back),\\nand the arms extended overhead holding the M16 or M4 training aid. Immediately upon entry, the Soldier\\nmoves legs together and the arms vigorously downward slapping the water with the weapon. This technique\\nkeeps the head above water and allows the Soldier to maintain visibility.\\n7-47. Upon entry into the water, the Soldier will stabilize buoyancy and simultaneously transfer weapon to\\nthe right side of the body grasping the sling close to the forward sling clamp with the right hand. The Soldier\\nplaces the weapon near the lower sling clamp onto the right hip while rolling onto left side. The Soldier\\nperforms the sidestroke to the edge of the pool and exits.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 7-13This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 8\\nNutritional Readiness\\nThe demands imposed by Army training, combat, and contingency operations are\\nunique and challenging. Nutritional readiness is the attainment of an individual\\nnutritional strategy that supports optimal physical and cognitive function as well as\\nlifelong disease and injury prevention. Nutritional readiness is a critical component of\\nholistic health, and contributes greatly to mission success. The development of a\\ncomprehensive performance nutrition program, tailored to organizational\\nrequirements, can improve individual Soldier performance, overall unit readiness, and\\nmission success. This chapter describes basic nutrition concepts and integrates them\\ninto performance nutrition plans and practical nutrition recommendations for the\\nSoldier.\\nFOUNDATIONAL NUTRITION\\n8-1. The Army\u2019s comprehensive performance nutrition program concept and framework encompasses three\\ncomponents\u2014proactive, active, and reactive. The proactive component, or foundational nutrition, entails\\nchronic disease prevention and immune system enhancement. The active component, or operational\\n(occupational and environmental task-specific performance) nutrition, focuses on event fueling and post-\\nevent recovery and arduous environment preparedness. The reactive component, or therapeutic nutrition,\\ncenters on specific nutritional interventions to treat (as opposed to prevent) an illness, injury, or condition.\\nWhen tailored to organizational requirements, unit- and culture-specific nutrition education and services can\\noptimize individual Soldier performance, overall unit readiness, and ultimately, mission success.\\n8-2. For Soldiers to perform optimally throughout their careers in assignments with varying levels of mental\\nand physical requirements, they must be proactive and place as much emphasis on foundational health as\\nthey do on task-specific performance. This entails chronic disease prevention and immune system\\nenhancement.\\nHEALTH PROMOTION AND CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION\\n8-3. The nutritional foundation established by a Soldier\u2019s usual dietary intake, or \u201ceveryday diet,\u201d can\\ngreatly reduce preventable future disease. More than 60 years of peer-reviewed research has demonstrated\\nthe importance of the everyday diet to the health and longevity of an individual. Soldiers can capitalize on\\nthese findings by consuming more whole-grain products, fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, dairy\\nproducts, and fish, and less processed grains, added sugars, and processed meats.\\nDIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS\\n8-4. The United States Department of Health and Human Services (known as HHS) and the United States\\nDepartment of Agriculture (known as USDA) jointly publish the Dietary Guidelines for Americans every 5\\nyears. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans provides evidence-based food and beverage recommendations\\nfor Americans ages 2 and older. These recommendations aim to promote health, prevent chronic disease, and\\nhelp people reach and maintain a healthy weight, and should be used to develop the Soldier\u2019s baseline healthy\\neating pattern.\\n8-5. An eating pattern represents all foods and beverages consumed. All foods consumed as part of a\\nhealthful eating pattern unite to meet nutritional needs that promote a healthy weight, enhance performance,\\nand prevent chronic disease. Soldiers aim to meet their nutrient needs through healthful eating patterns\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 8-1Chapter 8\\ncomprised of primarily nutrient-dense (such as essential vitamins and minerals, complex carbohydrates, lean\\nprotein, and healthy fats) whole foods. A healthy eating pattern includes the following:\\n\\uf06c A variety of vegetables from all of the subgroups\u2014dark green, red and orange, legumes (beans\\nand peas), and starchy (potatoes, corn, and winter squash).\\n\\uf06c Fruits, especially whole fruits.\\n\\uf06c Grains, at least half of which are whole grains.\\n\\uf06c Fat-free or low-fat (1 percent) diary, including milk, yogurt, cheese, fortified soy beverages, or\\ncombination of these.\\n\\uf06c A variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and\\npeas), and nuts, seeds, and soy products.\\n\\uf06c Oils high in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats.\\nA HEALTHY EATING PATTERN\\n8-6. A healthy eating pattern limits\u2014\\n\\uf06c Added sugar\u2014consume less than 10 percent calories per day from added sugar.\\n\\uf06c Saturated and trans fats\u2014less than 10 percent calories per day from saturated fats.\\n\\uf06c Sodium\u2014consume less than 2300 milligrams per day from sodium.\\nImportance of calorie balance within a healthy eating pattern\\nManaging calorie intake is fundamental to achieving and maintaining calorie balance\u2014\\nthe balance between the calories taken in from foods and the calories expended from\\nmetabolic processes and physical activity.\\nKEY COMPONENTS OF HEALTHY EATING PATTERNS\\n8-7. All foods and many beverages contain calories, and the total number of calories varies depending on\\ntheir macronutrients. On average, carbohydrates and protein contain 4 calories per gram, fats contain 9\\ncalories per gram, and alcohol has 7 calories per gram. The total number of calories a person needs each day\\nvaries on factors including the person\u2019s age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity. A need to\\nlose, maintain, or gain weight and other factors such as recent injury or illness affect how many calories to\\nconsume each day.\\n8-8. Eat a variety of vegetables that meets the following requirements:\\n\\uf06c Recommended intake: Vegetables from all of the subgroups\u2014dark green (for example, spinach,\\nkale, and broccoli), red and orange (for example, bell pepper, carrot, and sweet potato), legumes\\n(for example, beans and peas). These include fresh, frozen, canned, and dried options in cooked\\nor raw forms, including vegetable juices.\\n\\uf06c Key nutrients: Vegetables are important sources of many nutrients, including dietary fiber,\\npotassium, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin K, copper, magnesium, vitamin E, vitamin B6, folate,\\niron manganese, thiamin, niacin, and choline. Each vegetable subgroup contributes different\\ncombinations of nutrients, making it important for Soldiers to consume vegetables from all the\\nsubgroups. For example, dark-green vegetables provide the most vitamin K, red and orange\\nvegetables the most vitamin A, legumes the most dietary fiber, and starchy vegetables, the most\\npotassium. Vegetables in the \u201cother\u201d vegetable subgroup provide a wide range of nutrients in\\nvarying amounts. Include each vegetable subgroup weekly to meet nutrient needs because each\\nsubgroup provides different nutrients.\\n\\uf06c Considerations: Soldiers consume vegetables with limited additions such as salt, butter, or creamy\\nsauces. When selecting frozen or canned vegetables, choose those lower in sodium. At every meal,\\nstrive to make half of the plate fruit and vegetables.\\n8-9. Eat fruits that meet the following requirements:\\n8-2 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Nutritional Readiness\\n\\uf06c Recommended intake: The fruit group includes whole fruits and 100 percent fruit juice. Whole\\nfruits include fresh, canned, frozen, and dried forms. One cup (8 ounces) of 100 percent fruit juice\\ncounts as 1 cup of fruit. Although fruit juice can be part of healthy eating patterns, it is lower than\\nwhole fruit in dietary fiber, and when consumed in excess can contribute extra calories. When\\njuices are consumed, they should be 100 percent juice, without added sugars. Also, when selecting\\ncanned fruit, choose options that are lowest in added sugars. One-half cup of dried fruit counts as\\none cup-equivalent of fruit. Similar to juice, when consumed in excess, dried fruits can contribute\\nextra calories.\\n\\uf06c Key nutrients: Fruits provide nutrients that include dietary fiber, potassium, and vitamin C. Include\\neach fruit subgroup weekly to meet nutrient needs because each subgroup provides different\\nnutrients.\\n\\uf06c Considerations: At every meal, strive to make half of the plate fruit and vegetables.\\n8-10. Eat grains, especially whole grains, that meet the following requirements:\\n\\uf06c Recommended intake: At least half the grains Soldiers consume should be whole grains. Healthy\\neating patterns include whole grains and limit the intake of products made with refined grains,\\nespecially those high in saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium, such as cookies, cakes, and some\\nsnack foods. The grains food group includes grains as single foods (for example, rice, oatmeal,\\nand popcorn), as well as products that include grains as an ingredient (for example, breads, cereals,\\nand pasta). Grains are either whole or refined. Whole grains (for example, brown rice, quinoa, and\\noats) contain the entire kernel, including the endosperm, bran, and germ. Refined grains lack bran\\nand germ, which removes dietary fiber, iron, and other nutrients.\\n\\uf06c Key nutrients: Whole grains are a source of nutrients, such as dietary fiber, minerals, and vitamins.\\nWhole grains vary in their dietary fiber content. Most refined grains are enriched, a process that\\nadds back iron and four B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and folic acid). The term \u201cenriched\\ngrains\u201d often describes these refined grains.\\n\\uf06c Considerations: When consuming whole grain products, the whole grain should be the first or\\nsecond ingredient. For foods with multiple whole-grain ingredients, they should appear near the\\nbeginning of the ingredients list.\\n8-11. Consume dairy products that meet the following requirements:\\n\\uf06c Recommended intake: This group includes milk, yogurt, cheese, and fortified soy beverages. Soy\\nbeverages fortified with calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin D are part of the dairy group because\\nthey are similar to milk based on nutrient composition and in their use in meals. Other products\\nsold as \u201cmilks\u201d but made from plants (for example, almond, rice, and coconut) may contain\\ncalcium and be consumed as a source of calcium. However, these plant products are not part of\\nthe dairy group because their overall nutritional content is not similar to dairy milk and fortified\\nsoy beverages. The recommended amounts of dairy are 3 cup-equivalents per day.\\n\\uf06c Key nutrients: The dairy group contributes many nutrients, including calcium, phosphorus,\\nvitamin A, vitamin D (in products fortified with vitamin D), riboflavin, vitamin B12, protein,\\npotassium, zinc, choline, magnesium, and selenium.\\n\\uf06c Considerations: Fat-free and low-fat (1 percent) dairy products provide the same nutrients, but less\\nfat (and thus, fewer calories) than higher fat options, such as 2-percent and whole milk and regular\\ncheese. Fat-free or low-fat milk or yogurt, in comparison to cheese, contain less saturated fats and\\nsodium, and more potassium, vitamin A, and vitamin D. Choose fat-free or low-fat dairy foods to\\nlimit the amount of saturated fat while still benefitting from the potassium, Vitamin A and Vitamin\\nD provided by these foods. Limit cheese as a dairy choice to further limit saturated fat and sodium\\nintake. Soldiers who are lactose intolerant can choose low-lactose and lactose-free dairy products.\\nThose who do not consume dairy products should consume foods that provide nutrients generally\\nobtained from dairy, including protein, calcium, potassium, magnesium, vitamin D, and vitamin\\nA (for example, fortified soy beverages).\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 8-3Chapter 8\\n8-12. Consume protein sources that meet the following requirements:\\n\\uf06c Recommended intake: Foods in the protein group include choices from both animal and plant\\nsources and includes several subgroups: seafood; meats, poultry, and eggs; and nuts, seeds, and\\nsoy products. Legumes may be considered part of the protein foods group, as well as the vegetables\\ngroup. Protein also is found in some foods from other food groups (for example, dairy). A specific\\nrecommendation for at least 8-ounce equivalents of seafood per week is also recommended as part\\nof a healthy eating pattern. One-half ounce of nuts or seeds counts as 1 ounce-equivalent of protein\\nfoods, and because they are high in calories, Soldiers eat them in small portions and used to replace\\nother protein foods rather than being added to the diet.\\n\\uf06c Key nutrients: Protein foods are important sources of nutrients in addition to protein, including B\\nvitamins (for example, niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline,\\nphosphorus, zinc, copper, vitamin D, and vitamin E. Nutrients provided by various types of protein\\nfoods differ. For example, meats provide the most zinc, while poultry provides the most niacin.\\nSeafood provides the most vitamin B12 and vitamin D, in addition to heart healthy fats. Eggs\\nprovide the most choline, and nuts and seeds provide the most vitamin E. Soy products are a source\\nof copper, manganese, and iron, as are legumes.\\n\\uf06c Considerations: When selecting protein foods, nuts and seeds should be unsalted, and meats and\\npoultry should be consumed in lean forms. Processed meats and processed poultry are sources of\\nsodium and saturated fats. Processed meats are meat products that have been transformed through\\nsalting, curing, fermentation, smoking, or other processes to enhance flavor or improve\\npreservation (for example, hot dogs, bologna, salami, pepperoni, and bacon). Saturated fats, added\\nsugars, and total calories are within limits in the resulting eating patterns. Choose fresh meat\\noptions more often than processed meats to limit intake of sodium and saturated fats. The inclusion\\nof protein foods from plants allows vegetarian options to be accommodated.\\n8-13. Consume oils that meet the following requirements:\\n\\uf06c Recommended intake: Oils are fats that are liquid at room temperature. Although they are not a\\nfood group, oils are emphasized as part of healthy eating patterns because they are the major source\\nof essential fatty acids and vitamin E. Commonly consumed oils extracted from plants include\\ncanola, corn, olive, peanut, safflower, soybean, and sunflower oils. Oils also are naturally present\\nin nuts, seeds, seafood, olives, and avocados. The fat in some tropical plants, such as coconut oil,\\npalm kernel oil, and palm oil, are not included in the oils category because they do not resemble\\nother oils in their composition. Specifically, they contain a higher percentage of saturated\\n(unhealthy) fats than other oils.\\n\\uf06c Key nutrients: Oils supply calories and help absorb the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.\\nOTHER DIETARY COMPONENTS\\n8-14. Limit consumption of added sugar. Added sugars include syrups and other caloric sweeteners. When\\nsugars are added to foods and beverages to sweeten them, they add calories without contributing essential\\nnutrients. Consumption of added sugars can make it difficult for Soldiers to meet their nutrient needs while\\nstaying within calorie limits. Naturally occurring sugars, such as those in fruit or milk, are not added sugars.\\nExamples of added sugars that can be listed as an ingredient include brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup,\\ndextrose, fructose, glucose, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, lactose, molasses, raw sugar, and sucrose:\\n\\uf06c Recommended intake: Healthy eating patterns limit added sugars to less than 10 percent of calories\\nper day. This recommendation is a target to help Soldiers achieve a healthy eating pattern, which\\nmeans meeting nutrient and food group needs through nutrient-dense food and beverage choices\\nand staying within calorie limits. When added sugars in foods and beverages exceed 10 percent of\\ncalories, a healthy eating pattern may be difficult to achieve.\\n\\uf06c Considerations: Replacing added sugars with high-intensity sweeteners may reduce calorie intake\\nin the short-term, yet questions remain about their effectiveness as a long-term weight\\nmanagement strategy. High-intensity sweeteners approved by the United States Food and Drug\\nAdministration (FDA) include saccharin, aspartame, and sucralose. Based on the available\\nscientific evidence, FDA determined these high-intensity sweeteners safe for the general\\npopulation.\\n8-4 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Nutritional Readiness\\n8-15. Soldiers need to limit sodium consumption. Healthy eating patterns limit sodium to less than 2,300\\nmilligrams per day for adults. Sodium is an essential nutrient and is needed by the body in relatively small\\nquantities, provided that substantial sweating does not occur.\\n8-16. Soldiers need to limit alcohol consumption. In the strictest sense, alcohol is not a performance nutrient.\\nIf Soldiers consume alcohol, it should be in moderation\u2014up to one drink per day for women and up to two\\ndrinks per day for men\u2014and only by adults of legal drinking age. One alcoholic drink-equivalent consists\\nof\u2014\\n\\uf06c 12 fluid ounces of regular beer (5 percent alcohol).\\n\\uf06c 5 fluid ounces of wine (12 percent alcohol).\\n\\uf06c 1.5 fluid ounces of 80 proof distilled spirits (40 percent alcohol).\\nThe amount of alcohol and calories in beverages varies. Soldiers account for alcohol within the limits of\\nhealthy eating patterns so that they do not exceed calorie limits.\\nBODY COMPOSITION\\n8-17. The body is comprised of water, protein, minerals, and fat. A two-compartment model of body\\ncomposition divides the body into a fat component and fat-free component. The total amount of body fat\\nconsists of essential fat and storage fat. Fat in the marrow of bones, heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys,\\nintestines, muscles, and certain tissues throughout the central nervous system is called essential fat. Non-\\nessential body fat is called storage fat. Normal bodily function requires essential fat. Women have higher\\nessential fat than men because it includes sex-characteristic fat related to child bearing. Storage fat is located\\naround internal organs (internal storage fat) and directly beneath the skin (subcutaneous storage fat). It\\nprovides bodily protection and serves as an insulator to conserve body heat. The relationship between\\nsubcutaneous fat and internal fat may not be the same for all individuals and may fluctuate during the life\\ncycle.\\n8-18. Lean body mass represents the weight of your muscles, bones, ligaments, tendons, and internal organs.\\nLean body mass differs from fat-free mass (known as FFM). Since there is some essential fat in the marrow\\nof your bones and internal organs, the lean body mass includes a small percentage of essential fat. However,\\nwith the two-component model of body composition, these sources of essential fat are estimated and\\nsubtracted from total body weight to obtain the fat-free mass. Practical methods of assessing body\\ncomposition such as skinfold thickness (or caliper) testing, bioelectrical impedance analysis, air displacement\\nplethysmograph, and hydrostatic weighing are based on the two-compartment (lean body mass and fat-free\\nmass) model of body composition. The three-compartment model of body composition includes a third\\ncomponent where the fat-free mass is further divided into lean tissue mass and bone mineral content. The\\ndual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (known as DEXA) scan is an example of a three-compartment model of\\nbody composition assessment. Soldiers should consult with a registered dietitian or the Army Wellness\\nCenter for assistance with body composition assessments and interpretation of results.\\n8-19. Optimal lean body mass to fat-free mass ratios for Soldiers differ depending upon their primary and\\nsecondary mission roles. Dietitians consider chronic disease risk, individual illness and injury patterns, body\\ncomposition history, ethnicity, and specific mission requirements when determining their most effective task-\\nspecific body composition. Soldiers should be reminded that physical performance cannot be accurately\\npredicted solely based on body weight and composition. A single and rigid optimal body composition should\\nnot be recommended for any physical training event or unit of Soldiers.\\n8-20. Following a healthy eating pattern (consuming the number of servings of carbohydrate, protein and\\nhealthy fats from the food groups to meet individual calorie needs) supports a healthy body composition. The\\nfrequency, intensity, and type of physical activity also impact body composition. To perform optimally at\\nany physical task requires proper nutrition combined with physical training. All Soldiers are encouraged to\\nachieve and maintain body composition. See AR 600-9 for standards for body fat.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 8-5Chapter 8\\nBODY MASS INDEX\\n8-21. Body mass index (BMI) is a population screening measure commonly used to rapidly assess health\\nand classify individuals as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.\\nBMI = weight (in kilograms) / height (in meters) squared = kg/m2\\n8-22. Reference standards developed for the United States population by race and gender, so that individuals\\nat risk for obesity can be easily identified. However, the reference value for the U.S. population does not\\nalways apply to special populations, such as Soldiers, who may have a higher BMI but acceptable body\\ncomposition. BMI is a screening tool that just assesses height to weight ratio but does not indicate body\\ncomposition. Leaders may refer their Soldiers to a registered dietitian or the Army Wellness Center for more\\naccurate body composition analysis to track progress. AR 600-9 indicates the weight for height ratio\\nscreening tool for Soldiers. Leaders can use monthly weigh-ins and taping to keep track of changes in a\\nSoldier\\'s body composition. However, all Soldiers must adhere to the body fat guidelines outlined in\\nAR 600-9.\\nWEIGHT LOSS\\n8-23. For some Soldiers, injury, stress, lack of time, frequent travel, or other reasons might contribute to a\\nhigher-than-optimal weight. They need to determine what might contribute to a body composition higher in\\nbody fat. It is important to evaluate the amount of food and calorie-containing beverages consumed each day\\nand to reduce the total number of calories per day to reduce body fat. It takes dedication to make adjustments\\nto eating habits, portion sizes, food choices, physical activity, sleep hygiene, and stress management.\\nNutrition goals should be realistic as weight loss does not happen overnight. Soldiers can generally sustain a\\nweight loss of 0.5-1 pound per week. To prevent lean muscle loss and nutrient deficiencies, women should\\nconsume no less than 1200 calories per day; men should consume no less than 1500 calories per day.\\n8-24. Soldiers use the following tips to achieve a healthy weight:\\n\\uf06c Track food intake using a daily food log.\\n\\uf06c Focus on an eating plan that consists of nutrient rich, lean sources of protein\u2014including fish,\\npoultry, beans, nuts, and dairy products\u2014and incorporate whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.\\n\\uf06c Choose low calorie beverages such as water, low-fat milk (or soy milk), and unsweetened\\nbeverages with and between meals to stay hydrated.\\n\\uf06c Be mindful of hunger and fullness cues, keeping in mind it takes 20 minutes to feel full, so eating\\nslowly and mindfully is helpful to prevent eating more calories than intended.\\n\\uf06c Keep a food log to stay aware of the number of calories consumed and to know whether the calorie\\ngoal is met or not. This supports understanding whether further changes in eating habits are\\nrequired to support weight loss.\\n\\uf06c Stay hydrated and do not starve yourself. There is a balance in caloric consumption and\\nexpenditure to achieve the right amount of weight loss while not affecting physical performance.\\nGoals change depending on work schedules. For example, trainees who struggle to have enough energy to\\nperform the physical components in BCT should not focus on losing weight; their current goal should focus\\non fuel to perform. Once they have passed the physical standards, then they can shift their focus to weight\\nloss.\\nWEIGHT GAIN\\n8-25. Combat missions and training require muscular strength and endurance. To optimize performance and\\nprevent musculoskeletal injuries while attempting to gain weight, Soldiers need to combine an appropriate\\nstrength training program with a well-planned nutritional strategy. The most effective method to increase\\nmuscle mass is to encourage a positive energy balance, for example, by consuming more calories than\\nrequired to maintain current body weight. Theoretically consuming an additional 250\u2013500 calories per day\\nabove typical requirements would result in a gain of one half to one pound per week.\\n8-26. Many Soldiers may believe more protein is the best way to gain weight, when in fact, eating more\\nprotein than the established recommendation does not provide any additional benefit. To encourage lean body\\n8-6 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Nutritional Readiness\\nmass growth, daily protein consumption should increase to 1.2\u20132.0 grams/kilograms (~0.55\u20130.9\\nounces/pound) body weight.\\n8-27. Soldiers use the following tips to help add more calories to their eating plan:\\n\\uf06c Eat frequently. Plan to eat or drink a food or beverage that provides nutrition to the body every\\nfew hours, especially after a workout.\\n\\uf06c Consume protein-rich foods. The best sources of protein come from whole foods such as lean\\nmeats, poultry, fish, beans, nuts, eggs, and low-fat dairy.\\n\\uf06c Try smoothies, shakes, or soups. Liquids can be an easy way to load up on calories in a small\\nvolume. However, these food items should be nutrient dense, meaning they have a high amount\\nof beneficial nutrients (for example, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and lean protein) in relation to their\\nweight and low in added sugars. Add Greek yogurt, milk, soymilk, powdered milk, flaxseeds, or\\nchia seeds to smoothies, shakes, and soups.\\n\\uf06c Add healthful fats. Use avocado or nut butter in sandwiches or smoothies, and add a little extra\\nolive oil, canola oil, or oil-based spreads during meal preparation.\\nOPERATIONAL NUTRITION\\n8-28. With a focus on foundational health through a deliberate everyday diet, Soldiers are better positioned\\nto optimize task-specific performance nutrition through event fueling and post-event recovery, and arduous\\nenvironment preparedness.\\nEVENT FUELING AND POST-EVENT RECOVERY\\n8-29. Soldiers consider some factors when choosing pre-event, during, and post-event fueling and recovery\\nnutritional strategies. Although not all-inclusive, these factors include\u2014\\n\\uf06c Usual macronutrient intake (such as carbohydrate, protein, and fat).\\n\\uf06c Time lapse between macronutrient intake and start of physical activity.\\n\\uf06c Duration and intensity of physical activity.\\n\\uf06c Environmental conditions.\\n\\uf06c Individual gut tolerance.\\n\\uf06c Personal taste preference.\\n\\uf06c Duration of fueling.\\n\\uf06c Body composition goals impact performance.\\n8-30. Energy or calorie needs increase with increases in exercise frequency, intensity, time, and type.\\nSoldiers should adjust needs based on the type of exercise completed. These four variables are often referred\\nto as the F.I.T.T. principle. Energy needs will fluctuate as changes in frequency, intensity, time, and type\\noccur, therefore Soldiers should consult with a registered dietitian to determine their energy needs and how\\nto adjust for alterations in physical activity, physical demands of duty, or both.\\nNUTRIENT TIMING\\n8-31. Nutrient timing involves proper fueling strategies before, during, and after physical training sessions\\nand other strenuous activity. If done correctly, solid strategies can help to prevent energy deficits and aid in\\nadequate recovery. When Soldiers consume nutrients is just as important as what nutrients they consume.\\nEach and every body functions differently in response to fueling for training, so it is recommended that each\\nSoldier practice with nutrient timing while training. Dietitians do not recommend applying recommendations\\nfor nutrient timing right before an ACFT or a performance event. Remember to train like you fight. The\\nWarfighter Nutrition Guide contains strategies and recommendations for all aspects of performance nutrition\\nfor Soldiers.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 8-7Chapter 8\\nBefore Exercise\\n8-32. Before strenuous activities, consuming carbohydrate-rich foods and fluids in the 2-4 hours before\\nexercise helps to restore liver glycogen, increase muscle glycogen stores, and prevent hunger. Soldiers who\\nlose appetite or feel nauseated shortly before training or ACFT should allow at least 3-4 hours between a\\nmeal and performance. Eating before gastric distress occurs allows the athlete to get the calories needed and\\ncan prevent vomiting related to nervousness. The same guidance applies to Soldiers who get diarrhea shortly\\nbefore or during training. Anxiety increases gastric contractions that move food through the gastrointestinal\\ntract. Eating can stimulate the bowls even more, so dietitians recommend eating well ahead of a physical\\nevent.\\n8-33. Research suggests a pre-exercise meal containing 1 to 4 grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of body\\nweight, consumed 1 to 4 hours prior to exercise provides improved performance. Table 8-1 provides\\nexamples of pre-exercise meals. If unable to consume a meal prior to early morning exercise, consuming\\napproximately 30 grams of easily digested carbohydrate-rich food or fluid (for example, banana, applesauce,\\nor toast with peanut butter) one hour prior to exercise is beneficial.\\nTable 8-1. Examples of pre-exercise meals\\nTime Between Eating and\\nSuggested Pre-Exercise Meals\\nPerformance\\n1 hour or less before exercise Choice of:\\nFresh fruit such as apples, watermelon, peaches, grapes, oranges, or a\\nsports energy bar and/or\\n\u00bd\u20131 \u00bd cups (4\u201312 ounces) of carbohydrate electrolyte beverage\\n2\u20133 hours before exercise Choice of:\\nFresh fruit, 100-percent fruit or vegetable juices and/or\\nBreads, bagels, English muffins with limited amounts of butter or\\nmargarine or cream cheese, yogurt, oatmeal, pancakes with limited\\namounts of butter and syrup, or a sports energy bar and/or\\n2\u20134 cups (16\u201332 ounces) of carbohydrate electrolyte beverage\\n3\u20134 hours before exercise Choice of:\\nFresh fruit, 100-percent fruit or vegetable juices and/or\\nBreads, bagels, baked potatoes, cereal with milk, yogurt, sandwiches\\nwith a small amount of peanut butter, lean meat, or cheese, spaghetti\\nwith a tomato sauce and/or\\n4\u20137 \u00bd cups (32\u201360 ounces) of carbohydrate electrolyte beverage\\nDuring Exercise\\n8-34. Consuming carbohydrates during exercise lasting greater than 60 minutes can delay the onset of fatigue\\nand improve endurance capacity by maintaining blood glucose levels. Table 8-2 outlines the recommended\\ncarbohydrate intake during exercise.\\nTable 8-2. Recommended carbohydrate intake during exercise\\nType of Activity Recommended Carbohydrate Intake\\nExercise lasting less than 45 minutes None necessary or practical\\nHigh-intensity exercise lasting 45 to 75 minutes Small amounts of sports drink or\\ncarbohydrate-rich snacks or foods\\nEndurance and intermittent, high intensity exercise lasting 1 30\u201360 grams per hour\\nto 2.5 hours\\nEndurance and ultra-endurance exercise lasting 2.5 to 3 80\u201390 grams per hour\\nhours or longer\\n8-8 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Nutritional Readiness\\nAfter Exercise\\n8-35. Using an effective refueling strategy after exercise can help to optimize recovery and promote the\\ndesired adaptations to training. Replenishment of glycogen occurs faster after exercise due to the increased\\nblood flow to the muscles, the increased ability of the muscle cell to take in glucose, and the muscle cells\\nsensitivity to the effects of insulin during this period. As such, exercise promotes glycogen synthesis\\n(restoring glycogen in the liver and muscle).\\n8-36. It is critical to provide the body with 50\u2013100 grams of carbohydrate (2 grams of carbohydrates per\\nkilogram of body weight) and 15\u201325 grams of high-quality protein (5\u20139 grams protein per 100 grams of\\ncarbohydrates) within 30\u201360 minutes after exercise. This protein helps replenish muscle glycogen stores,\\nstimulate muscle protein synthesis, and repair damage caused by intense exercise. If unable to eat a meal\\nwithin 60 minutes of completing exercise, Soldiers might snack on 8 ounces (1 cup) low-fat chocolate milk,\\n8 ounces (1 cup) 100-percent fruit juice and a handful of nuts (about \u00bc cup), 2 slices whole grain bread with\\npeanut butter and a banana, or 8 ounces (1 cup) low-fat yogurt and a piece of fresh fruit (for example, 1\\nmedium apple, 1 medium orange, 1 banana). When refueling, Soldier should eat a combination of foods and\\nfluids with carbohydrates and protein to refuel targets.\\nHYDRATION\\n8-37. It does not take much water loss for performance to suffer. A mild dehydration (as measured by a\\nchange in body weight) of less than 1 percent can have a slightly negative influence on cognitive function.\\nThis involves slowed working memory, increased tension or anxiety and fatigue, and increased error-related\\nto visual vigilance. A 2-percent dehydration more severely impacts mental function, mood, and energy level.\\nFluid Recommendations\\n8-38. Fluid requirements can vary from 2\u201316 liters per day depending on workload, level of heat stress, and\\nsweat rate. Sweat loss varies depending on age, training, and acclimation status, exercise intensity and\\nduration, air temperature, humidity, wind velocity, cloud cover, clothing, and individual sweat rates.\\n8-39. On average, 20\u201325 percent of fluid intake comes from food and 75\u201380 percent from beverages. Plain\\nwater, coffee, tea, soups, fruits, and vegetables provide fluids to support hydration. A small amount of\\ncaffeine in tea or coffee (< 200 milligrams) should not negatively affect hydration status, but if Soldiers drink\\nmore caffeine, their fluid balance may be negatively affected.\\n8-40. Typically, voluntary consumption of fluids\u2014drinking to thirst\u2014restores only some lost fluid.\\nWhenever possible, dietitians should use weight loss to quantify fluid loss during physical activity. Table 8-3\\nshows fluid recommendations before, during, and after exercise. TB MED 507 provides a comprehensive\\nguide for fluid replacement and work/rest guidelines for warm weather training conditions.\\nTable 8-3. Fluid recommendation before, during, and after exercise\\nRecommendation\\nBefore Drink at least 8\u201316 oz. (1\u20132 cups) of fluid 2 hours prior to exercise. Drink at least 4\u20138 oz.\\n(1/2\u20131 cup) of fluid immediately prior to exercise.\\nDrink 1\u20132 mL per pound body weight (for example, 2/3\u20141 \u00bc cups for 150 lb.) 2 hours prior\\nto exercise.\\nDuring Drink at least 4\u20138 oz. (1/2\u20131 cup) of fluid every 15\u201320 minutes during exercise.\\nDo not exceed 1.5 liter (~6 cups) per hour.\\nAfter Drink at least 8\u201316 oz. (1\u20132 cups) of fluid after exercise.\\nFor rapid rehydration, drink ~3 cups of fluid per lb. of body weight lost.\\nL liter lb pound mL milliliter oz ounce\\nElectrolyte Recommendations\\n8-41. Electrolytes control the fluid balance of the body and are important in muscle contraction, among many\\nother essential functions. Electrolytes (such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and chloride) come\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 8-9Chapter 8\\nfrom food and fluids. The loss of sodium and potassium in sweat can be quite high during prolonged physical\\nactivity, especially in warm weather. Replacing these elements is an important part of the recovery process.\\nMost commercially available fluid replacement beverages contain electrolytes. Roughly, 1\u20132 grams of\\nsodium per liter of fluid (0.25 teaspoons per quart\u201432 ounces) effectively replaces the sodium lost during\\nexercise or a mission. Also, sodium is widely present in various foods and fluids, such as bagels, tomato\\njuice, sports drinks, and milk.\\nCarbohydrate and Electrolyte Beverages (\u201cSports Drinks\u201d)\\n8-42. Fluids providing carbohydrate, electrolytes, sodium, and potassium can sustain athletic performance.\\nThe drinks aim to\u2014\\n\\uf06c Maintain hydration during exercise.\\n\\uf06c Ensure rehydration after exercise.\\n\\uf06c Replace electrolytes lost during sweating.\\n\\uf06c Supplement carbohydrate stores and provide fuel for the working muscles during exercise.\\n\\uf06c Minimize muscle fatigue from strenuous workouts.\\n\\uf06c Protect the immune system.\\n8-43. Although sports drinks containing electrolytes enhance endurance performance, many Soldiers use\\nthese drinks as a recreational fluid. This only adds calories, artificial coloring and flavors to their dietary\\nintake. Dietitians recommend sports drinks when exercise lasts longer than 60 minutes and then, Soldiers\\nshould only ingest 237 milliliters (eight ounces or one cup) every 15 minutes. For activities less than one\\nhour, water is the best choice for hydration needs. Short, low intensity workouts do not lose minimal sodium\\nand potassium through sweat and do not deplete glycogen stores. The ideal sports drink contains\u2014\\n\\uf06c 82\u2013163 milligrams sodium per 237 milliliters (8 ounce) serving.\\n\\uf06c 18\u201346 milligrams potassium per 237 milliliters (8 ounce) serving.\\n\\uf06c 12\u201324 grams carbohydrate per 237 milliliters (8 ounce) serving.\\n8-44. Soldiers should drink sports drinks if a training event is strenuous and takes place greater than 4 hours\\nbefore or after a meal (such as before breakfast or at night). These recommendations are especially important\\nfor personnel not acclimatized to the environment and for activity with heavy sweating. Dietitians encourage\\nSoldiers to consume salty foods at meal time, choose foods high in water content (such as fruits and\\nvegetables), and not restrict carbohydrate intake. If Soldiers choose to drink juice, they dilute the juice with\\nwater to 50/50 solution which dilutes the sugar content to prevent diarrhea.\\nOral Rehydration Solutions\\n8-45. Oral rehydration solutions (known as ORS) are classified as medical materiel by the FDA and are\\navailable as subsistence supply (Class VIII) items. Dietitians use these solutions to treat and prevent\\ndehydration due to diarrhea. These solutions contain approximately three to five times the amount of sodium\\nand potassium found in typical carbohydrate-electrolyte beverages. If used improperly, oral rehydration\\nsolutions may lead to various adverse health effects. Leaders do not use rehydration solutions for IMT\\ntrainees for routine hydration to prevent heat illness or heat injury. However, for training that includes\\npurposeful food restriction (for example, Ranger or Special Forces), unit surgeons decide to supplement\\nintake with rehydration solutions. Regular consumption of meals and recommended drinking protocols\\nadequately provides a Soldier with a good electrolyte-sodium balance for most physical training activities.\\nLeaders can use sports drinks or rehydration solutions if the training situation dictates the need for such\\nproducts in the prevention or treatment of heat illness, and most especially hyponatremia incidents.\\n8-10 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Nutritional Readiness\\nOVERHYDRATING\\nOverhydrating can cause excessive dilution of sodium in the\\nblood, a potentially life-threatening condition called hyponatremia.\\nIn situations where Soldiers are drinking to a schedule or regimen\\nover prolonged periods of less intense physical activity, it is\\nimportant to consider risk factors, signs, and ways to mitigate this\\ncondition.\\nRISK FACTORS:\\n\\uf0b7 Cool and less humid conditions that make fluid loss\\nconsiderably less than expected\\n\\uf0b7 Overconsumption of beverages that have low sodium content\\n\\uf0b7 Inadequate food consumption along with over hydration\\nSIGNS:\\n\\uf0b7 Swollen fingers\\n\\uf0b7 Disorientation\\n\\uf0b7 Abdominal bloating\\n\\uf0b7 Reduced urine output\\nMITIGATION STRATEGIES:\\n\\uf0b7 Adequate food consumption\\n\\uf0b7 Carbohydrate\u2013electrolyte beverage consumption after more\\nthan 60 minutes of activity\\nDIETARY SUPPLEMENTS (CAFFEINE, SPORTS DRINKS, ENERGY DRINKS, ELECTROLYTE\\nDRINKS)\\n8-46. The most common reasons military personnel give for using dietary supplements include improving\\nperformance, increasing muscle mass, enhancing energy level, accelerating recovery, increasing alertness,\\nboosting the immune system, and improving joint function. The best sources of information on dietary\\nsupplements are dietitians, certified specialists in sports dietetics, health care providers, or pharmacists.\\n8-47. Soldiers who purchase supplements should be aware that these products target our human desire for\\nhealth and performance shortcuts. Some may be damaging and dangerous: if a product or claim sounds too\\ngood to be true, it probably is. Soldiers need to consider the consequences of taking various supplements,\\neither alone or in combination. They also need to check that the source of the information obtained for making\\nthat decision is trustworthy.\\nDietary Supplements and the Law\\n8-48. Well over 50 percent of the U.S. population takes some type of dietary supplement. To understand why\\ndietary supplements use is a concern, one must appreciate the history. In 1994 the Dietary Supplement Health\\nand Education Act (DSHEA) was passed by Congress to\u2014\\n\\uf06c Limit barriers to marketing and promoting dietary supplements.\\n\\uf06c Provide for wide availability of supplements to consumers.\\n\\uf06c Enhance information available to consumers.\\n8-49. The passing of DSHEA gave the FDA regulatory control over dietary supplements, and the law\\nrequired that the label of a dietary supplements provide the name and quantity of each ingredient. It is the\\nrole of the manufacturer to provide this information; however, this is often not the case. (See discussion\\nbeginning in paragraph 8-53 for guidance on informed selection of supplements.)\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 8-11Chapter 8\\n8-50. The FDA also regulates whether new ingredients can enter the marketplace or existing ones should be\\nremoved for safety reasons. However, federal rules do not require dietary supplement makers to test\\nsupplement ingredients. The FDA also regulates what claims may (or may not) be made, but it does not\\nmonitor claims. The regulations within DSHEA contain many gaps. Some of the concerns include\u2014\\n\\uf06c The responsibility of ensuring products are properly labeled lies with the manufacturer.\\n\\uf06c Supplement ingredients sold in the United States before October 15, 1994 are presumed safe and\\nare therefore not subject to review by the FDA for safety.\\n\\uf06c The responsibility of providing evidence of safety lies with the manufacturer.\\n\\uf06c If a product is already on the market, the FDA must provide evidence that it is not safe.\\n\\uf06c Government resources to check dietary supplement quality are limited.\\n8-51. In June 2007, FDA imposed new regulations that had been mandated by DSHEA. The FDA established\\nregulations that dietary supplements must be produced in a quality manner, do not contain contaminants or\\nimpurities, and are accurately labeled. Supplement manufacturers are now required to test all the ingredients\\nin their products to make sure they are not contaminated but that does not mean the ingredients are safe.\\nCombining and Stacking Supplements\\n8-52. Once dietitians know what a supplement contains, they consider what might happen when multiple\\nsupplements are combined, or \u201cstacked.\u201d The concept of \u201cstacking\u201d is a concern. The number of potential\\nstacking combinations is staggering and the effects of combinations of ingredients are, for the most part,\\nunknown. One stacking approach that has proven deadly is the \u201cEAC\u201d stack, with ephedra, aspirin, and\\ncaffeine. Now that the FDA has banned ephedra, Soldiers use ephedra-free products (promoted as safe)\\ndespite the fact that they are as unsafe as ephedra-based supplements. Ephedra-free supplements are\\ndangerous because\u2014\\n\\uf06c The supplements contain high levels of stimulants often in combination with caffeine.\\n\\uf06c FDA does not require the makers of the supplements to list the quantity or amount of the stimulants\\nin their products.\\nConsumer Safety Tips\\n8-53. Operation Supplement Safety (known as OPSS) is a joint initiative between the Human Performance\\nResources Center (known as HPRC) and the DOD to educate Service members, retirees, their family\\nmembers, leaders, healthcare providers, and DOD civilians about dietary supplements and how to choose\\nsupplements wisely. The Operation Supplement Safety website at https://www.opss.org/ provides easy access\\nto materials and databases for Soldiers to stay informed and make healthy dietary supplement choices. The\\nArmy Public Health Center site at https://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/healthyliving/n/Pages/default.aspx also\\nhas information on nutrition and dietary supplements.\\n8-54. FDA requires manufacturers to list all product ingredients on the \u201cSupplement Facts\u201d panel of a dietary\\nsupplement label as well as the amount of each by weight, except when the ingredients are part of a\\n\u201cproprietary blend.\u201d A proprietary blend is a collection of ingredients often unique to a particular product\\nand sometimes given a special name on a product\u2019s Supplement Facts panel. A proprietary blend might be\\nlisted as a \u201cblend,\u201d \u201ccomplex,\u201d \u201cmatrix,\u201d or \u201cproprietary formulation.\u201d Many proprietary blends contains\\nstimulant (or stimulant-like) ingredients. Stimulants found in supplements can include caffeine, yohimbe,\\nand phenethylamines, as well as illegal ingredients such as DMAA (1,3-dimethylamylamine), DMBA (1,3-\\ndimethylbutylamine), BMPEA (beta-methyl-phenethylamine), and methylsynephrine. Laboratory testing is\\nthe only way to know contents in any particular dietary supplement product, which is why Soldiers need to\\nlook for third-party certification.\\n8-55. Soldiers identify third-party certification by seals that appear on some supplement products. These\\nseals confirm independent testing and evaluation of dietary supplements and their ingredients and ensure that\\nmanufacturing and storage facilities comply with good manufacturing practices requirements. The companies\\nthat conduct such reviews vary widely in how they certify and how they test products. Certification seals\\nconfirm that a product contains the ingredients listed on the label, but they do not ensure a product\u2019s\\neffectiveness or safety.\\n8-12 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Nutritional Readiness\\n8-56. The Natural Medicines database, a resource accessed through the Operation Supplement Safety\\nwebsite, is free for Soldiers. It provides in-depth information about dietary supplement products and\\ningredients based on the best available scientific evidence.\\nENVIRONMENT\\n8-57. Nutritional requirements largely depend on environmental conditions. Hot or dry environments require\\ndifferent levels and types of nutrition than cool or moist environments. High altitudes demand different\\nnutritional requirements than low altitudes, and so on. This section describes how nutritional requirements\\nvary between environments as well as the conditions in those environments that drive specific nutritional\\nneeds.\\nNUTRITION FOR MISSIONS IN THE HEAT\\n8-58. Repetitive movement along difficult terrain with heavy gear, such as during land warfare operations,\\nis challenging under any environmental condition, but is particularly grueling with extreme heat and\\nhumidity. Land warfare scenarios where Soldiers carry heavy loads or injured comrades increase overall\\neffort and energy expenditure, as well as fluid and electrolyte needs. The major concerns during operations\\nin a warm or hot environment are fluid and electrolyte balance.\\n8-59. Working or exercising in the heat intensifies water and electrolyte loss through sweating. The amount\\nof sweat and fluid lost depends on\u2014\\n\\uf06c Environmental temperature and humidity.\\n\\uf06c Work rate.\\n\\uf06c Fitness level and acclimatization.\\n\\uf06c Volume and rate of fluid replacement.\\n8-60. When the same task carried out in thermo-neutral environment (such as a range of temperatures of the\\nimmediate environment in which a standard healthy adult can maintain normal body temperature) is\\nperformed in a hot environment, energy requirements increase slightly due to the increased work to maintain\\nthermal balance. When living or working in temperatures ranging from 86\u2013104\u00b0 F (30\u201340\u00b0C), energy intakes\\ntypically increase by 2.5\u201310 percent unless activity level decreased accordingly. However, heat-acclimated\\nindividuals likely will not have an increase in energy requirements.\\n8-61. High work rates in hot, humid surroundings can significantly increase fluid and electrolyte losses.\\nLosses of one to two quarts per hour or even more are likely when special clothing, such as chemical\\nprotective gear, body armor, or both are worn. The highest sweat rates reported exceed over five quarts (160\\nounces) per hour.\\n8-62. Soldiers need fluids and need to drink early and drink often. Starting any operation without being\\nadequately hydrated may increase the risk of performance mishaps. Some believe that relying on thirst is\\nadequate for sustaining hydration, whereas others believe that thirst itself is an indicator of dehydration. For\\ncertain, failure to replace lost fluids from sweating results in dehydration and possibly heat injury.\\n8-63. Leaders avoid forcing Soldiers to drink throughout training in a warm environment to ensure adequate\\nfluid replacement. Too much water can result in hyponatremia. Effective leaders have a pre-determined\\ndrinking schedule to ensure Soldiers consume enough fluids. Soldiers ideally drink \u00bc\u2013\u00bd quart or liter (8\u201316\\nounces or 1\u20132 cups) of fluid every 30 minutes, and no more than 1 quart or liter (32 ounces or 4 cups) per\\nhour.\\n8-64. Obtaining body weights before and after activity can help determine fluid replacement needs. One\\nkilogram weight loss requires 1,000 milliliters of fluid to restore fluid balance (or 16 ounces per pound weight\\nloss). A fluid loss of 2-percent body weight can impair physical performance and mood, decrease appetite,\\nand increase the risk of heat injuries. A 5-percent loss of body weight can decrease work performance by 30\\npercent.\\n8-65. Soldiers monitor their hydration in the field. In the field when it is difficult, if not impossible, to obtain\\na body weight, Soldiers use their urine color and smell to gauge hydration status. Dark yellow or smelly urine\\nsuggests some degree of dehydration. Soldiers then increase fluid consumption until urine becomes pale\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 8-13Chapter 8\\nyellow. If taking B vitamins, Soldiers may have bright yellow urine, not pale, regardless of hydration status.\\nAnother method for assessing hydration is frequency and volume of urination with a goal of urinating every\\n2\u20133 hours.\\n8-66. Excessive loss of electrolytes from sweating can lead to muscle cramping or severe medical problems.\\nBeing in excellent physical condition helps minimize electrolyte losses, but Soldiers given free access to\\nwater when exercising in the heat replace only one half to two thirds of their fluid losses. Additionally,\\nelectrolyte balance may be compromised due to the use of hydration packs which provide only water. Soldiers\\nmay need to consume snacks, fluids, or both with electrolytes during and after missions or periods of grueling\\nand prolonged training. Due to limits to how much sodium and potassium should be provided in sports\\nbeverages, fluid replacement alone may not be adequate for restoring or maintaining electrolyte balance.\\n8-67. Foods that naturally provide sodium and potassium should be selected. Dried fruits are optimal food\\nchoices for potassium. Even if heat acclimatization has occurred, leaders must understand the importance of\\nsalt: 200\u2013400 milligrams of sodium can be lost per pound of sweat, along with sodium excreted in the urine.\\nAdding salt to foods (1/2 teaspoon provides 1,200 milligrams) or including sodium-rich foods in the diet\\nhelps retain water and avoid a sodium deficit. Sodium is the most critical electrolyte for maintain fluid\\nbalance.\\nNUTRITION FOR MISSIONS IN THE COLD\\n8-68. Exposure to a cold environment seriously challenges the human body. Blood vessels tighten to\\nconserve heat and shivering is initiated to generate heat and guard against hypothermia. Side effects of these\\nresponses are an increase in urine output and an increase in energy metabolism. Therefore, the most important\\nnutritional considerations for a cold environments are\u2014\\n\\uf06c Energy intake.\\n\\uf06c Glycogen stores.\\n\\uf06c Fluid status.\\n\\uf06c Vitamin and mineral needs.\\nSee also ATP 3-90.97 for guidance on nutritional requirements in cold weather and high-altitude\\nenvironments.\\nEnergy Intake\\n8-69. Energy requirements can increase 25\u201350 percent during cold weather operations as compared to warm\\nweather operations. Even mildly cold temperatures (32\u201357\u00b0 F) can increase energy requirements 5\u201310\\npercent. Factors that increase caloric intake include\u2014\\n\\uf06c Added exertion due to wearing heavy gear.\\n\\uf06c Shivering, which can increase resting metabolic rate by two to four times the normal level.\\n\\uf06c Increased activity associated with traveling over snow and icy terrain.\\n\\uf06c Increased activity to keep warm.\\n8-70. Many studies have shown Soldiers tend to progressively lose weight when conducting two- to three-\\nweek field exercises in the cold. Because significant weight loss can result in fatigue and declined\\nperformance, energy intake should meet the increased energy demands.\\n8-71. Energy expenditure for Soldiers during periods of physical exertion in the cold may range between\\n4,200 to 5,000 calories per day. When temperatures justify high levels of cold-weather protection (for\\nexample, Extreme Cold Weather Clothing System and the Vapor Barrier Boot), energy requirements may\\nincrease to approximately 54 calories per kilogram of body weight. Energy needs are higher (approximately\\n62 calories per kilogram of body weight) when Soldiers maneuver for prolonged periods (2 hours or more)\\nwith heavy gear on their feet (for example, snowshoes and skis) over snow- and ice-covered terrain. These\\nincreased energy requirements do not apply to troops located in cold climates with limited exposure to\\noutdoor temperatures.\\n8-72. Although carbohydrate consumption is critical, a diet that provides 35 percent of the energy as fat may\\nbe necessary to match energy needs. Ideally, during cold weather operations, 50\u201360 percent of energy should\\n8-14 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Nutritional Readiness\\ncome from carbohydrate, 30\u201335 percent from fat, and 10\u201320 percent from protein, high carbohydrate snacks\\nshould be eaten between meals. Both fat and carbohydrate are important energy sources in a cold\\nenvironment. A high protein diet is not advised as it may increase fluid requirements.\\n8-73. Missions in cold weather require foods that produce heat. Foods high in carbohydrate produce more\\nheat through digestion than either fat or protein. Hot beverages, such as cocoa, provide carbohydrate and\\nother warm beverages, to include coffee, teas, and broth, increase body temperature, enhance mental\\nawareness and provide comfort.\\nGlycogen Stores\\n8-74. Prior to deploying to a cold environment, the pre-mission diet should ensure that glycogen stores are\\noptimized. Likewise, a high carbohydrate diet is preferred during cold exposure, as carbohydrates are needed\\nto replenish glycogen being used to maintain core temperature. A minimum of 400 grams of carbohydrate\\nare necessary in the cold. Thus, Soldiers should eat regular meals and snacks providing carbohydrate to\\nmaintain carbohydrate intake. Including a liquid or solid carbohydrate supplement may be critical for\\nmaintaining energy balance and performance.\\nFluid Status\\n8-75. Becoming dehydrated in cold environments is easy because of the cold-induced increases in urine\\noutput, increased fluid losses through breathing, involuntary reduction in fluid intake, and sweating. Because\\ndehydration decreases performance and potentially may lead to various medical problems, maintaining fluid\\nstatus by drinking plenty of fluids and monitoring hydration is absolutely critical. Table 8-4 provides tips for\\nmaintaining fluid status in cold environments.\\nTable 8-4. Tips for maintaining fluid status\\nForce yourself to drink 480\u2013960 mL (16\u201332 ounces) of warm fluid at hourly intervals (240\u2013480 mL or\\n8\u201316 ounces per 30 minutes).\\nAvoid alcoholic beverages: alcohol tends to increase heat and urine losses.\\nDrink beverages with CHO to increase energy intake (5-8% CHO and some electrolytes is best).\\nDo not eat snow without first melting and purifying it.\\nModerate caffeine consumption.\\nCHO carbohydrate mL milliliter\\nVitamin and Mineral Needs\\n8-76. The requirements for some vitamins and minerals increase when working in the cold due to increases\\nin energy metabolism and urinary losses. The amount of daily vitamin and mineral needs may increase during\\ncold weather operations. In most cases, Soldiers can meet energy requirements and vitamin and mineral needs\\nby eating all ration components.\\nNUTRITION FOR MISSIONS AT HIGH ALTITUDE\\n8-77. High altitude missions, to include flying, can cause bodily distress. Adequate nutrition is crucial for\\nmaintaining performance. The major nutritional concerns at high altitude are\u2014\\n\\uf06c Weight loss.\\n\\uf06c Carbohydrate intake.\\n\\uf06c Dehydration.\\n\\uf06c Oxidative stress.\\n8-78. Virtually all people who perform at high altitudes experience weight loss and loss of lean body mass.\\nAt altitudes below 5,000 meters, Soldiers can prevent weight loss by vigilantly eating on a regular basis.\\nAbove 5,000 meters, a 5\u201310 percent weight loss is inevitable. The only way to minimize weight loss is by\\nbeing vigilant about maintaining energy intake. Energy intakes should range from 3,500\u20136,000 calories per\\nday, which is equivalent to eating at least four Meals, Ready-to-Eat (known as MREs) or two high-calorie\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 8-15Chapter 8\\nindividual rations daily. The latter is a compact, eat-on-the-move individual ration intended to be consumed\\nduring initial stages of intense conflict. Leaders should consider using high-calorie individual rations for\\nshort duration (for example, 1\u20133 days), highly-mobile dismounted missions. Leaders may also consider\\naugmenting (not replacing) operational rations with modular operational ration enhancement (known as\\nMORE) Type I for high altitude or cold weather (Type II for hot weather) training events. Leaders should\\nconsider using the modular operational ration enhancement when missions require extra calories due to heavy\\nactivity in extreme environments. Some reasons for weight loss at high altitude include the following:\\n\\uf06c Increased energy requirements to 115\u2013150 percent of sea-level requirements.\\n\\uf06c Decreased sense of taste, which causes a reduction in food intake.\\n\\uf06c Changes in metabolism of fat and carbohydrate.\\n\\uf06c Loss of body water from increased breathing rate and dry air.\\n\\uf06c Impaired absorption of nutrients.\\n\\uf06c Acute mountain sickness, which can cause nausea, vomiting, headache and decreased appetite.\\nCarbohydrate Intake\\n8-79. High carbohydrate foods are the preferred energy source at altitude and in flight because they\u2014\\n\\uf06c Restore glycogen.\\n\\uf06c Require less oxygen to produce energy than fat.\\n\\uf06c Are the most efficient energy source.\\n\\uf06c Can diminish and delay the progression or severity of acute mountain sickness symptoms.\\n\\uf06c Maintain blood glucose.\\nDiets should provide at least 400 grams of carbohydrate and carbohydrate should contribute 50\u201370 percent\\nof total energy. This can be accomplished by eating high carbohydrate snacks between meals and drinking\\nbeverages containing carbohydrate during strenuous activity, long flights, and recovery.\\nDehydration\\n8-80. Exposure to high altitude is associated with significant levels of dehydration because water losses are\\nincreased. If Soldiers do not replace these losses, dehydration will result. Some studies suggest that vigorous\\nhydration may decrease the incidence and severity of acute mountain sickness. The reasons dehydration\\noccurs at high altitude include the following:\\n\\uf06c Increased respiratory losses due to increased ventilation (such as increased supply of air to the\\nlungs).\\n\\uf06c Increased urine output due to altitude and cold temperatures.\\n\\uf06c Possible diarrheal fluid losses.\\n\\uf06c Failure to drink water.\\n\\uf06c Poor access to water.\\n8-81. Fluid requirements may be greater than 3700 milliliters (4 quarts or 128 ounces) per day at high\\naltitude. To avoid acute mountain sickness, Soldiers maintain a drinking schedule and monitor hydration\\nstatus daily.\\nNUTRITION FOR MISSIONS IN WATER AND AT DEPTH\\n8-82. Like exposure to altitude and cold environments, water operations, especially cold water operations,\\nare associated with increased energy expenditure and fluid losses. Thus nutritional concerns for diving are\\nmaintaining\u2014\\n\\uf06c Energy intake.\\n\\uf06c Fluid intake.\\n\\uf06c Mineral balance.\\n\\uf06c Antioxidant balance.\\n8-16 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Nutritional Readiness\\nEnergy Intake\\n8-83. When working at the same rate in water as on land, the energy expenditure to accomplish the same\\ntask is greater in water. The reasons for this increased energy expenditure during water operations include\u2014\\n\\uf06c Greater resistance offered by water.\\n\\uf06c Decreased efficiency of movement when thermal protective clothing are worn.\\n8-84. Soldiers rapidly use glycogen stores when performing hard work in cold water. They must replace\\nthese stores between operations to prevent performance decrements. Increasing carbohydrate intake before\\nan anticipated dive has been shown to improve and extend exercise performance during prolonged dives.\\nFluid Intake\\n8-85. Immersion in water increases urinary excretion by 2\u201310 times above normal. Without adequate\\nhydration, a diver can quickly become dehydrated and suffer from decline in performance. For example,\\nimmersion during a single dive for 3\u20136 hours can result in a 2\u20138 pound loss in body weight by urination; this\\nis equivalent to losing 1\u20133 quarts of fluid. Importantly, a diver must drink fluids with carbohydrate whenever\\npossible to maintain blood glucose. A decline in blood glucose is known to negatively affect performance.\\nMineral Balance\\n8-86. Immersion in water, especially cold water, increases urinary losses of magnesium, calcium, zinc, and\\nchromium. Soldiers need to consume foods high in these important minerals to restore immersion-included\\nlosses.\\nTHERAPEUTIC NUTRITION\\n8-87. Fundamental risks associated with mission requirements, and the environments in which Soldiers\u2019\\noperate, increase the potential for medical treatment over a Soldier\u2019s career. Medical nutrition therapy is the\\nuse of specific nutritional interventions to treat an illness, injury, or nutrition-related condition. Continuous\\nnutrition support from the time of diagnosis, to management or remission, is essential for rapid return to duty.\\nINJURIES\\n8-88. Good nutrition aids in recovery. Management of calories and essential nutrients\u2014based on pre-injury\\nnutrition status and severity or type of trauma suffered\u2014helps the treatment of common combat- and training-\\nrelated injuries. These injuries include burns, minor and traumatic wounds, and traumatic brain injuries.\\n8-89. Though wound healing often increases calorie and protein needs, dietitians need to balance these\\nrequirements with decreased needs associated with long periods of injury-induced reductions in physical\\nactivity. If body fat and muscle mass changes are not monitored closely by a registered dietitian throughout\\nthe rehabilitation process, the Soldier\u2019s return to full duty may be delayed. Soldiers should seek nutrition\\ncounseling from a registered dietitian for wound healing, delayed rehabilitation outcomes, and unintentional\\nbody composition changes related to recovery.\\nMEDICAL CONDITIONS\\n8-90. Beyond acute injuries and illnesses, medical nutrition therapy for the treatment of familial-and\\nlifestyle-associated conditions also contribute to a Soldier\u2019s readiness and longevity. These conditions can\\ninclude hypertension (high blood pressure), insulin resistance (high blood sugar), and dyslipidemia (high\\ncholesterol and/or triglyceride (fats) in the blood). Soldiers should seek nutrition counseling from a registered\\ndietitian for the treatment of familial- and lifestyle-associated conditions.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 8-17This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 9\\nMental Readiness\\nSoldiers must be capable of overcoming adversaries at a moment\u2019s notice. To do this,\\nSoldiers must be mentally as well as physically ready. They must possess the physical,\\ncognitive, emotional, and interpersonal capabilities to fight and win in multi-domain\\noperations. This chapter provides tools, techniques, and resources for leaders and\\nindividuals to maximize Soldier and team performance through the development,\\nsustainment, or restoration of mental readiness. This chapter discusses the purpose,\\nimpact and the components of mental readiness as well as strategies for mental\\nreadiness development.\\nMENTAL READINESS CONCEPTS\\n9-1. Mental readiness is an individual\u2019s or team\u2019s ability to think, feel, and act in a manner that optimizes\\nperformance in a demanding environment or with occupational and combat-specific tasks. Mental readiness\\nincludes the ability to integrate cognitive, emotional and interpersonal capabilities. Mental readiness, like\\nphysical readiness can be improved and requires intentional training to achieve peak levels of performance.\\nOptimizing Soldier readiness requires maximizing the mental and physical readiness of the Soldier and his\\nor her team. Many organizations, from professional sports teams to special operations groups, value mental\\nreadiness. Leaders in these organizations play an active role in creating and sustaining a climate that\\nencourages individual and team mental readiness in accordance with unit needs.\\n9-2. Unlike physical, sleep, and nutritional readiness, mental readiness is difficult to standardize and\\nmeasure. Conceptual notions of what makes a mentally ready Soldier often differ with empirical findings.\\nMoreover, reconciling stable personality traits with fluid Army roles and assignments is a daunting task. For\\nexample, what might appear to be the perfect mental readiness profile for success in BCT might not be\\nappropriate for the operational force or a specific MOS.\\n9-3. Soldiers\u2019 roles and jobs change, complicating the requirements for sustained character and\\npsychological training across a Soldier\u2019s lifecycle. Individualized intervention has enormous value in crisis\\nsituations such as the prevention of drug and alcohol abuse, misconduct behavior, safety violations, and\\nsuicide. Therefore, commanders must consider this doctrine as providing best solutions and messaging for\\nthe collective mental health of the unit\u2014procedures and tactics that allow Soldiers to prepare for, thrive in,\\nand recover from the ordinary and extraordinary stressors that might degrade readiness.\\n9-4. Mental readiness doctrine provides tools, techniques, and resources for Soldiers and teams engaged in\\nthe development, sustainment, or restoration of mental readiness. Soldiers must possess exceptional mental\\nflexibility and endurance, morals and ethics, self-initiative, and an ability to operate within the commander\u2019s\\nintent. Mental readiness is a foundational consideration in the H2F System. It includes the integration of\\ncognitive, emotional, and interpersonal capabilities. Leaders must incorporate individual and unit mental\\nreadiness training into the unit\u2019s battle rhythm.\\n9-5. Within the H2F System, teams are staffed and resourced to support leaders and individuals in the\\ntraining of mental readiness. Leaders should seek their assistance to enable them to focus time and energy on\\nprimary functions while mental readiness improvement can be trained by experts in an appropriate, effective,\\nand efficient manner.\\n9-6. Optimal mental readiness is required for optimal team or unit cohesion. Mentally ready Soldiers can\\nleverage protective factors against physical and environmental stressors typically encountered in complex\\nmilitary environments.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 9-1Chapter 9\\n9-7. Mental readiness is required to achieve capabilities the Army must possess to win in multi-domain\\noperations. These capabilities include, but are not limited to\u2014\\n\\uf06c Train Soldiers and leaders to ensure they are prepared to accomplish the mission across the range\\nof military operations while operating in complex environments against determined and adaptive\\nenemy organizations.\\n\\uf06c Develop resilient Soldiers, adaptive leaders, and cohesive teams committed to the Army\\nprofessional ethic who can accomplish the mission in environments of uncertainty and persistent\\ndanger.\\n\\uf06c Develop agile, adaptive, and innovative leaders who thrive in conditions of uncertainty and chaos,\\nand are capable of visualizing, describing, directing, leading, and assessing operations in complex\\nenvironments and against adaptive enemies.\\n\\uf06c Understand, visualize, describe, direct, lead, and assess operations consistent with the philosophy\\nof mission command to seize the initiative over the enemy and accomplish the mission across the\\nrange of military operations.\\nMENTAL READINESS CAPABILITIES\\n9-8. Mental readiness includes three interrelated capabilities\u2014cognitive, emotional and interpersonal. Just\\nas physical readiness requires training and integration of a variety of components (for example, muscular\\nendurance, muscular strength, balance, flexibility, and agility), optimizing mental readiness requires the\\ntraining and integration of a variety of capabilities. See figure 9-1.\\nFigure 9-1. Mental readiness capabilities\\n9-9. One approach to developing mental readiness capabilities involves using the Goal, Plan, Do, Check\\nstrategy. Leaders can use the strategy to coordinate mental readiness capability development in a variety of\\ncircumstances.\\n9-10. Goals are established by the Soldier in collaboration with the mental readiness experts on the H2F\\nperformance team. Goals are specific to a task. Goals must be clearly articulated using the SMART\\nprinciples\u2014S for specific, M for measurable, A for attainable, R for relevant, and T for the time period in\\nwhich the goal must be attained.\\n9-11. Leaders develop plans to accomplish the goal. The plan consists of the way a Soldier will be coached\u2014\\nthe tactics, techniques, and procedures used to promote or optimize the development of the mental capability.\\nThese are individualized for the Soldier.\\n9-12. Doing the plan is the action or actions taken by the Soldier and the team to achieve the goal. The doing\\npart of the strategy involves teaching, training, practice, and implementation.\\n9-2 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Mental Readiness\\n9-13. Finally, the leader checks the strategy for effectiveness. The check makes sure that the goal has been\\nmet and if it has not, is retrained.\\nCOGNITIVE CAPABILITY\\n9-14. Cognitive capability is the ability to expand and integrate knowledge into decisions with an\\nunderstanding of how values and beliefs influence a Soldier\u2019s thoughts and ultimately his or her performance.\\nIt is the acquisition and demonstration of knowledge and understanding through processes such as memory,\\nattention, problem-solving, decision-making, judgment, reasoning, and learning.\\n9-15. Soldiers and leaders require the ability to process large amounts of information and make sound\\ndecisions\u2014a process that can be complicated by the rapid evolution and intensity of combat. Self- and team\\nawareness of personal, spiritual, and cultural beliefs and values can assist with self and team accountability.\\nThis awareness combined with an understanding of the commander\u2019s intent can lead to improved problem\\nsolving and more effective decision making. When leaders discuss ethics and values in the context of the\\nmission, they are positively influencing cognitive capability.\\nCOGNITIVE LOAD\\n9-16. Cognitive load is the amount of information a Soldier can memorize in the short-term in order to learn\\nsomething new. During the learning process, Soldiers indicate mastery of new information by how much of\\nthat information they can recall and apply. Cognitive skills training uses various methods to optimize\\ncognitive load. These methods include limiting divided attention, breaking down new information into parts,\\nand using visual and auditory strategies.\\n9-17. When learning new tasks, the capacity of the Soldier may aid or degrade mastery of processing new\\ninformation and creating long-term memories. Soldiers must optimize short-term memories to create long-\\nterm memories, which is referred to as optimizing cognitive load. Cognitive load overwhelms the Soldier\\nwhen the incoming information is greater than the available cognitive resources. Soldiers forget the new\\ninformation resulting in poor performance.\\n9-18. There are three types of cognitive load: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane. Intrinsic cognitive load\\nrefers to the amount of information Soldiers need to hold in their working memory to comprehend a situation.\\nWorking memory is the short-term memory storage for selection and interpretation of new information. The\\nability to master new tasks depends on how quickly Soldiers can acquire, store, and retrieve information\\nespecially for a key task. If the task is complex, Soldiers with more capacity to optimize intrinsic load can\\nprocess and complete the task more effectively. Soldiers with less capacity may have to break the task into\\nsmaller steps to complete it. Soldiers can improve intrinsic load by reducing or simplifying tasks, using\\nlearning cues, or applying memory cues such as an acronym.\\n9-19. Extraneous cognitive load refers to how information is presented and the cognitive demands placed on\\nthe Soldier during task performance. For example, if instructions for a technical task are poorly presented,\\npresented in a noisy distracting setting, or presented out of sequence, then the Soldier may be less able to\\nproperly execute the task. Improving the delivery of the task instructions or training content may decrease\\nextrinsic cognitive load and result in more rapid mastery of the task. Some Soldiers may prefer getting\\nextensive, detailed instructions for a task whereas others may do better when provided with only an end goal\\nand key cues on how to execute. For example, when learning a front squat, Sergeant (SGT) Jones receives\\nmultiple specific instructions on proper form: keep shoulder blades back and engaged, keep spine straight,\\nkeep torso upright, place feet shoulder width apart. However, SGT Jones finds the information overwhelming\\nand cannot perform the lift comfortably. The next day, SGT Jones receives one simple instruction to lower\\nto the floor as if going to sit. While lowering, SGT Jones is cued to keep chest up. SGT Jones performs the\\ntask with increased comfort. In this example, SGT Jones extraneous cognitive load was decreased and\\nperformance improved.\\n9-20. Germane cognitive load refers to the Soldier\u2019s comprehension, application, and coordination of\\ninformation. This is the goal of learning. It is the ability of the Soldier to conceptualize and use information\\nto improve different skills. Long-term learning requires sustained deliberate mental effort. This conscious\\ncognitive processing improves the transfer of knowledge across different situations. Optimizing Soldier\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 9-3Chapter 9\\ncognitive performance occurs when Soldiers practice cognitive skills in ways that minimize extraneous load,\\nmanage intrinsic load, and maximize germane load.\\nATTENTION\\n9-21. Attention is the ability to sort through irrelevant information and thoughts (for example, \u201cI\u2019m hungry\u201d)\\nor surroundings (for example, weapons firing in the distance) to concentrate and focus on a specific task.\\nIrrelevant or distracting thoughts divide attention and lead to decreased information retention, poor\\nperformance, and safety violations. Attention also has a time component that can impact performance. For\\nexample, a Soldier\u2019s attention may focus on a mistake made several months ago rather than focusing on the\\npresent task. Additionally, a Soldier\u2019s attention may focus on a future mission, causing increased worry and\\ndecreased performance of the present task.\\n9-22. Attention is important in both garrison and operational settings. It requires deliberate, daily practice\\nfor mastery. Practice can take many forms ranging from personal reflection in quiet moments to following\\ndirections precisely during physical training. Personal reflection allows Soldiers to understand why or how\\nthey react to certain triggers or feelings and to craft a response that allows improved performance. Spending\\nseveral minutes each day reflecting on triggers, beliefs, and reactions can improve the ability to sort through\\nsensory input. For example, if Sergeant James knows he fires his weapon more accurately when in a relaxed\\nmental state, he can take actions to prepare his mind prior to firing. With practice, SGT James\u2019 awareness\\nand ability to relax his mind becomes a reflexive skill that transfers into operational settings, improving\\nlethality.\\n9-23. Leaders can use intense physical training to recreate the same physiological arousal that happens in\\nhigh-risk situations. Application of mental performance training during intense physical training improves\\nSoldiers\u2019 abilities to pay attention and make better decisions when under physical duress. This is applied in\\nfamiliar training events such as a stress shoot.\\n9-24. Adding mental skills training does not have to be physically or resource intensive. For instance,\\ncombine the task of entering and clearing a building with attentional control skills using a deck of playing\\ncards. Without letting Soldiers see it, set up an area (blank wall or board) with 2\u20133 playing cards. Instruct the\\nSoldiers to identify a specific set of information on each turn. At a signal, the Soldiers enter the area, observe\\nthe cards for 5 seconds, and return to the starting position. Soldiers must recall the set of information for each\\ncard. Gradually increase the difficulty by adding information to recall (number or face, suit, or other details),\\nincreasing number of cards staged, and/or decreasing observation time. The outcome of this exercise\\nincreases mental skills in attentional control, visual scanning, self-awareness, arousal control, and situational\\nawareness. Training these tactical mental skills can make large differences in success or failure during high-\\nrisk situations.\\n9-25. When thoughts interfere with performance, a routine can help Soldiers improve their attention. For\\nexample, Second Lieutenant Doe is worrying about her finances and is underperforming during physical\\ntraining. Her mental readiness routine involves loosening and retying her sneakers. When she starts that\\nprocess, she mentally cues herself, \u201cOnce I lace up my sneakers, my only focus for the next hour needs to be\\nphysical readiness training.\u201d This enables her to temporarily suppress the other thoughts affecting her\\nperformance.\\n9-26. Additional training to assist with attention includes concentration grids (see table 9-1) and other tools.\\nUsing the grid below as an example, find the numbers in ascending order and note time to complete. As\\nperformance improves, add rows or columns to the grid or external distractors to increase the level of\\ndifficulty.\\nEMOTIONAL CAPABILITY\\n9-27. Emotional capability is influenced by abilities such as arousal control, heart rate control, stress control,\\nperformance imagery, motivation, and self-talk. Leaders can train these abilities to optimize normal\\nphysiologic and emotional responses. These abilities help Soldiers combat intensely stressful, physical, and\\ncomplex situations. Regularly implementing strategies that improve emotional capability helps Soldiers to\\nachieve optimal mental readiness.\\n9-4 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Mental Readiness\\nTable 9-1.

Arousal refers to the amount of energy devoted to an individual\u2019s level of physical and mental\\nactivation. Activation levels vary along a spectrum from low (being asleep) to high (awake, active and\\nintensely excited). Activation levels shift across this spectrum throughout the day in response to actual and\\nperceived demands and level of training. For example, a Soldier participating in a six-mile foot march during\\nmorning physical training will likely have a significantly lower activation level than a Soldier performing\\nairborne operations for the first time. Activation levels also vary depending on the Soldier and the context.\\nSome individuals appear to remain \u201ccool and collected\u201d even during activities that would \u201cpsych out\u201d other\\nindividuals. Some Soldiers may not worry about rappelling from a tower while others may feel extreme\\nstress. Activation levels required to optimize task performance can vary between Soldiers. Figure 9-2\\nillustrates this between two Soldiers, A and B performing the same high-stress occupational tasks.\\nFigure 9-2. Activation levels in different Soldiers performing the same task\\n9-29. Understanding the physiological activation and mental operations that coincide with those states are\\ncrucial to overall mental readiness. By bringing awareness to the connection and communication between\\nthe body and brain, Soldiers can better control their state of activation. Involuntary or automatic physiological\\nresponses in the body\u2014such as heart rate, blood pressure, and hormone levels\u2014measure activation level.\\nSubjective measures of activation include self-talk, confidence, and motivation. Both combat and operational\\nstressors can lead to activation of these physical and mental responses, inducing the sympathetic nervous\\nsystem\u2019s fight or flight response (see paragraph 4-41 for more on fight or flight response).\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 9-5Chapter 9\\n9-30. Any threat, whether it be real or perceived, can result in this sympathetic response. Even non-combat\\nstressors such as a physical readiness test, a short-suspense deadline, family stressors, or a difficult commute\\ncan activate these physiological responses. They are inherently protective, increasing activation, reflexes,\\nand chances of survival in life or death situations.\\n9-31. One of the hormones released as a result of this protective response is cortisol, often referred to as the\\n\u201cstress hormone.\u201d Excessive production of cortisol contributes to chronic disease, poor executive cognitive\\nfunction, and increased susceptibility to injury and infection. When Soldiers are trained to control their\\nactivation levels, they can mitigate the negative impact of this physiological reaction. It helps Soldiers if they\\ncan understand how they react to stress at its initial onset. Table 9-2 outlines common physiological acute\\nand chronic stress responses.\\nTable 9-2. Physiological changes associated with the stress response\\nAcute, early phase of the stress response (duration in minutes to hours) symptoms:\\n\\uf0b7 Increased heart rate\\n\\uf0b7 Increased blood pressure\\n\\uf0b7 Increased respiration\\n\\uf0b7 Mobilization of energy from liver and body fat\\n\\uf0b7 Sharpening of attention and cognition\\n\\uf0b7 Increased fear conditioning (learning)\\n\\uf0b7 Blunting of pain\\n\\uf0b7 Altered intestinal motility\\n\\uf0b7 Release of cortisol and adrenaline\\nChronic, later phases of the stress response (duration in days to weeks) symptoms:\\n\\uf0b7 Suppression of immune system\\n\\uf0b7 Suppression of appetite and digestion\\n\\uf0b7 Suppression of growth factors\\n\\uf0b7 Suppression of reproductive factors\\n\\uf0b7 Persistence of increased heart rate and blood pressure for certain cases\\n\\uf0b7 Persistence of increased cortisol levels for certain cases\\n\\uf0b7 Release of stress hormones\\n\\uf0b7 Excessive muscle atrophy (muscle wasting) and redistribution of fat\\nHEART RATE CONTROL\\n9-32. An effective way to inhibit or enhance the fight or flight response and aide in activation control is by\\nmonitoring heart rate. Intentional breathing can influence heart rate. By inhaling for a five- to seven-second\\ncount and exhaling for a five- to seven-second count, Soldiers can slow heart rate, and increase time for\\nincreased oxygen exchange to take place in the lungs. Soldiers repeat this slow inhalation and exhalation for\\na few repetitions several times per day. Practicing this type of intentional, controlled breathing throughout\\nthe day improves activation control.\\n9-33. Soldiers can practice activation control immediately before or after performance of the target task.\\nAdding an activation control skill such as intentional breathing in mid-performance can improve performance\\nof the target task by helping to optimize a Soldier\u2019s physiological state when optimal performance is critical.\\nThe difficulty is incorporating these techniques into deliberate, routine practice so that it becomes a reflex in\\nthe midst of performing a drill or mission. One technique is simply paying attention to the feeling of air\\nmoving in and out of lungs for several seconds. This awareness acts as a checkpoint for the performance,\\nhelping to control breathing and monitoring levels of mental and physical activation. Breathing control is a\\nfamiliar component of several Soldier tasks and can be leveraged for activation control. For example, it is a\\nfundamental component of marksmanship.\\n9-6 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Mental Readiness\\n9-34. The example of the relationship between heart rate and task performance in table 9-3 applies only to\\nextreme stress (for example, stress associated with combat operations) or fear-induced increase in heart rate.\\nIncreases induced by exercise will not be the same as when fear or extreme stress cause an increase.\\nCombining fear or extreme stress with physical exertion can result in heart rates that table 9-3 will not capture.\\nSoldier heart rate responses vary. However, every Soldier can train to modulate heart rate response for\\ndifferent scenarios. Training that incorporates heart rate control with physical readiness training is important\\nso that Soldiers can perform occupational tasks with less stress-induced distraction.\\nTable 9-3. The effects on task performance of increasing levels of stress as measured by heart\\nrate (bpm)\\nLow Stress Moderate Stress High Stress\\nTask\\n115\u2013145 bpm 145\u2013174 bpm 175+ bpm\\nMotor skill Enhanced Deteriorated Shut down\\ncomplexity\\nVisual reaction Enhanced Decline Diminished\\ntime\\nCognitive Improved Declined Irrational response with\\nresponse time shut down of high function\\nDecision Quicker Deteriorated Reduced ability to\\nmaking speed communicate\\nbpm beats per minute\\nSTRESS CONTROL\\n9-35. Stress control is essential for mental readiness. As described in paragraph 9-34, stress is the body and\\nbrain\u2019s response to a threat. The interpretation of that threat is based on the perspective of the individual\\nSoldier. Thus, the same stressor may cause a positive stress reaction in one Soldier and a negative stress\\nreaction in another. Soldiers need to develop and cultivate individualized, group, and organizational resources\\nfor adapting to the unique demands of military tasks.\\n9-36. Practicing stress control strategies optimizes stress adaptability in what is known as the Yerkes-Dodson\\nLaw. This law explains a relationship between stress and performance. Without any stress, performance will\\nbe quite poor. As a Soldier experiences low to moderate levels of stress, performance will begin to increase.\\nHowever, as a Soldier\u2019s stress increases beyond his or her capacity, he or she becomes overwhelmed and\\nperformance begins to degrade. This point is known as a tipping point and is unique to the individual. Routine\\npractice of self-regulation and emotional control strategies helps Soldiers adapt to various stressful demands\\nwithin potentially prolonged high-consequence situations.\\nPERFORMANCE IMAGERY\\n9-37. Performance imagery is a mental readiness skill. It is the mental rehearsal or re-creation of an\\noccupational task or experience to improve performance of that task. Similar to the way dynamic stretching\\nprimes the Soldier\u2019s nerves and muscles for exercise, performance imagery primes the Soldier\u2019s brain to be\\nready for mental challenges. Performance imagery rehearses every step of a task, including reactions to\\npotential obstacles. This preventive action can increase confidence and improve outcomes in individual or\\nteam performance. It works best when the brain attempts to mentally replicate all the sensory inputs possible:\\nsight, smell, sound, texture, and proprioception (awareness of where the body is in space). The act of mental\\npractice promotes neural pathways between the brain and muscles involved in the task.\\n9-38. To practice performance imagery, Soldiers create an image of the environment and location where the\\ntask is actually taking place. Performance imagery is even more effective when physical movements are\\nrehearsed at the same time. If Soldiers will perform the task under high stress conditions, then they should\\ntry to imagine themselves under control, confident, or relaxed during the task. For example, to perform\\nsuccessfully on a combat testing lane for the Expert Field Medical Badge (known as EFMB), the Soldier will\\nimagine the lane at the test site. He or she will visualize all the details of the lane and each step of every task.\\nHe or she will imagine the smell of the smoke and the noise of simulated mortar rounds. He or she will\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 9-7Chapter 9\\nrehearse the physical movements required to hold a sling and tie it around a shoulder. He or she will imagine\\nthe steps of setting a fracture in a sling and visualize executing each task confidently and in a controlled\\nmanner.\\n9-39. A script can be developed for different tasks and can help with efficient performance imagery and can\\nbe easily performed in preparation for an event. Two examples are described in the following scripts.\\nFiring M4 Script\\n\u201cI will go up to my firing point and assume a prone supported firing position. My\\nbreathing is calm. I position my weapon inside my shoulder and under my collar bone.\\nI place my body at slight angle behind my weapon, legs shoulder width apart with laces\\nin the dirt. My breathing is calm. I look at my target. Breathe in\u2014breathe out. Rear sight\\naligned on my target. Body relaxed. At the command of the range operator, I load the\\nmagazine, place my weapon from safe to semi, and take a deep breath. I align my\\ntarget and breathe in, exhale, hold, and deliberately, smoothly squeeze the trigger.\u201d\\n3 Repetition Maximum Deadlift Script\\nImagine smelling the grass, feeling the wind, hearing your battle buddies around you.\\nImagine being at your optimal level of energy\u2014heart is beating fast but under control.\\nYour body is warmed up and feels ready. Imagine the texture of the bar grip as you\\nassume the starting position for the lift. Think about setting your shoulders and feet in\\npreparation for the lift. Think about you and the weight becoming one and raising\\nsmoothly and together from the ground as you exhale. Imagine your body straightening\\nat the top of the lift as your hips move under you. Imagine the controlled movement\\ndown to replace the weight quietly on the ground.\\nPOSITIVE EMOTIONS\\n9-40. Positive emotions include feeling enthusiastic, active, and alert. They include optimism, a sense of\\nhumor (ability to find humor under stress or when challenged), hope, and flexibility about change. Positive\\nemotions can impact overall health and wellness, rate, and completeness of recovery from injury and the\\nsustainment of abilities during a setback. Feelings that are typically pleasant and energizing for a person are\\nconsidered positive affect\u2014the term used to describe how a person feels and how those feelings are\\nexpressed. In a general sense, Soldiers tend to experience more positive affect than negative affect. They feel\\nenthusiastic, active, and alert. They have high levels of vitality and approach their daily tasks with vigor.\\nSoldiers are proficient at generating positive emotions. The most frequently occurring positive emotions are\\nlove, joy, gratitude, serenity, interest, hope, pride, amusement, inspiration, and awe.\\n9-41. Goal-setting is an effective tool for maintaining positive emotions. By defining short-term and long-\\nterm goals, small accomplishments are recognized along the way to overall achievement. Goal-setting\\nprovides a road map for success that can increase commitment towards achieving an objective. Progressively\\nmore difficult goals encourage improvements in physical and mental readiness. A clearly defined goal that a\\nSoldier has built on his or her own improves acceptance and the likelihood of reaching the goal. Examples\\nof the SMART process\u2014S for specific, M for measurable, A for attainable, R for relevant, and T for the time\\nperiod\u2014for goal-setting are described in table 9-4.\\n9-8 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Mental Readiness\\nTable 9-4.

Focusing on success even during stressful situations is an important aspect of mental readiness. It\\nreflects a Soldier\u2019s perceived confidence or ability to perform, which strongly correlates with successful\\noutcomes. Maintaining a positive mindset, or using positive self-talk, can make the difference in\\nperformance. Negative thoughts such as \u201cI have never been a runner,\u201d or \u201cI have never been athletic\u201d result\\nin a defeatist attitude and submaximal exertion.\\n9-43. Productive instructional self-talk helps to maintain focus on performing a task correctly, especially\\nwhen learning a new skill. A brief short phrase can be used with each activity to encourage optimal\\nperformance. For example, \u201cmy arms are strong\u201d or \u201cI am prepared.\u201d Soldiers with positive attitudes are\\nmore able to cope with adversity and be successful with challenging tasks. Motivational self-talk can improve\\nattitude and focus on the task.\\n9-44. Cognitive reframing is a type of self-talk strategy. If Soldiers are more open to recognizing the positive\\nin an otherwise suboptimal situation, they are more likely to respond in a productive way. Potentially negative\\nsituations can be viewed as an opportunity to learn. The more frequently Soldiers employ this strategy, the\\nmore likely that it will become their first course of action (see table 9-5).\\nTable 9-5. Examples of productive self-talk\\nType of self-talk When to use it Example\\nInstructional When learning, Squatting: inhale, knees out, exhale and squat.\\nprogressing or Prone firing: straight line from weapon to firing hip\\nperfecting a skill pocket, cheek to stock weld, high grip of firing hand, C-\\ngrip with non-firing hand.\\nMotivational Before or during an Deadlift: my body is strong and I am ready to lift heavy.\\nevent to increase focus Sling Load Test: I have thoroughly studied the necessary\\nand confidence materials to succeed.\\nCognitive Before an event or Running up hills: hills are my friend.

Interpersonal capability is the ability to facilitate team cohesion and the development and sustainment\\nof healthy, trusting relationships. Interpersonal capability includes effective communication techniques,\\ncaring for others, conflict resolution, and team building.\\nRELATIONSHIPS AND COMMUNICATION\\n9-46. Developing and maintaining good relationships requires effective communication. Poor\\ncommunication leads to isolation and difficulty coping with daily stressors. When Soldiers encounter\\nchallenges or stress, they find it much easier to cope if they have the support of unit, family, or community.\\nSoldiers are more effective in their professional mission if they can completely resolve conflicts with other\\nSoldiers and with their own doubts about the mission. Self-awareness, self-confidence, assertiveness, and\\nconflict resolution skills allow Soldiers to successfully navigate normal interpersonal problems.\\n9-47. Soldiers that communicate assertively and honestly with each other while demonstrating empathy\\n(understanding the situation from another\u2019s perspective) can better develop strong relationships with other\\nteam members. Assertive communication is objective, specific, and empathetic. This type of communication\\ncan also lead to strong team cohesion, making it easier to work through stressful or chaotic situations.\\n9-48. Communication in its basic form is a loop that involves one person sending an intended message\\nthrough a shared space to another person who receives a perceived message, and ideally provides feedback.\\nMany barriers exist that complicate communication. The barriers include, but are not limited to the following:\\n\\uf06c Physical.\\n\\uf06c Environment.\\n\\uf06c Emotional management of both the sender and receiver.\\n\\uf06c Culture.\\n\\uf06c Gender.\\n\\uf06c Communication channel (face to face, email, text message, radio, and so on).\\n\\uf06c Experience levels.\\n\\uf06c Physiological states.\\n9-49. The primary components of communication are nonverbal and verbal cues. The majority of\\ncommunication is nonverbal, meaning body language and facial expressions. Another major component of\\ncommunication is tone. The same message can have multiple meanings based on the pitch, speed, and\\nintonation. The meaning of the verbal messages, both the way it is intended and received, greatly depends on\\neach component. Increased awareness of importance of verbal and nonverbal communication can improve\\nperception of self and others, increase team dynamics, and enhance overall team performance.\\n9-50. Assertive communication is key when handing conflict because it is objective, specific, and\\nempathetic. Objective communication focuses on the task, not the Soldier performing it. When conflicts\\nmove from being objective to subjective communication, the resulting conflict can damage future team\\ndynamics. Assertive communication focuses on one or two specific corrections. The empathetic aspect of\\nassertive communication acknowledges that with each discussion, there are multiple people involved. Each\\nperson involved has his or her own point of view, needs, and goals. Empathetic communication responds to\\neach person\u2019s concerns to create a positive relationship. Leaders who regularly reflect on their\\ncommunication styles and behaviors are more inclined to use assertive communication in stressful situations,\\nwhen communication styles have the biggest impact.\\nENGAGEMENT\\n9-51. Engagement is a Soldier\u2019s willingness and tendency to fully contribute to the mission and remain\\ncommitted to the team\u2019s objectives. Engagement is required to achieve optimal individual and unit\\nperformance. Engagement requires that the Soldier understands the importance of being physically, mentally,\\nand spiritually ready. An engaged Soldier chooses behaviors that lead to team cohesion, performance, and\\nmission success.\\n9-10 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Mental Readiness\\n9-52. Cohesion can be either socially-based or task-based. Task cohesion represents the amount of work\\nSoldiers perform together to accomplish common goals. Social cohesion the term used to describe the affinity\\nSoldiers have for one another in the form of mutual respect. High social cohesion results from working\\ntogether toward shared goals and having respect for one another.\\nMental Readiness\\nTo optimize performance, Soldiers need to be mentally ready. Mental readiness is\\ndeliberately assessed and developed like any other skills through education, training,\\nand practice. To use a computing analogy, addressing both physical and mental\\nreadiness is a \u201csystems check\u201d on both the \u201chardware\u201d and the \u201csoftware\u201d that makes\\nan effective Soldier. The H2F System incorporates training techniques to develop\\nindividual and unit mental readiness.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 9-11This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 10\\n+Spiritual Readiness\\nThis chapter discusses spiritual readiness, the fourth domain in the H2F System. It\\nprovides tools and techniques for leaders and individuals exercising spiritual readiness\\ndevelopment, sustainment, or repair. It discusses what spiritual readiness is, the\\npurpose for spiritual readiness, who conducts or enables spiritual readiness, how\\nspiritual readiness is developed, and the aspects of spiritual readiness. Lastly, this\\nchapter lists resources available.\\nINTRODUCTION TO SPIRITUAL READINESS\\n10-1. Spiritual readiness develops the personal qualities a person needs in times of stress, hardship, and\\ntragedy. These qualities come from religious, philosophical, or human values and form the basis for character,\\ndisposition, decision making, and integrity. People develop their spiritual readiness from diverse value\\nsystems that stem from their religious, philosophical, and human values. The spiritual readiness domain is\\ninclusive and universally vital to all personnel no matter their background, philosophy, or religion. It applies\\nto both religious and non-religious persons and concepts. Leaders play an active role in creating and fostering\\na climate that encourages individual spiritual readiness according to their respective worldviews, while at the\\nsame time communicating respect and dignity for diversity in a pluralistic setting. (See AR 600-63 for more\\non spirituality.)\\n10-2. Spirituality is often described as a sense of connection that gives meaning and purpose to a person\u2019s\\nlife. It is unique to each individual. The spiritual dimension applies to all people, whether religious and non-\\nreligious. Identifying one\u2019s purpose, core values, beliefs, identity, and life vision defines the spiritual\\ndimension. These elements, which define the essence of a person, enable one to build inner strength, make\\nmeaning of experiences, behave ethically, persevere through challenges, and be resilient when faced with\\nadversity. An individual\u2019s spirituality draws upon parts of personal, philosophical, psychological, and\\nreligious teachings or beliefs, and forms the basis of their character. (See AR 350-53 for more on spirituality.)\\nUnderstanding the general spiritual readiness enables leaders to encourage personal spiritual readiness in a\\nclimate where mutual respect and dignity encourage dialogue, foster team cohesion, and enable healthy free\\nexercise of religion or no religion by all personnel. This approach enables and supports collective and\\nindividual readiness as Soldiers endure challenging and stressful conditions in training or operational\\nenvironments.\\n10-3. People enhance their spiritual readiness through reflection and practice of a lifestyle based on the\\npersonal qualities they need during times of stress, hardship, and tragedy. When their actions deviate from\\ntheir stated values, then they may experience inner conflict. Those struggling for integrity and congruity often\\nonly find inner peace after overcoming the struggle. They develop spiritual readiness by studying, connecting\\nwith, and understanding the value systems that mold their personal qualities. As their spiritual readiness\\ngrows, they become a leader of character and build the resilience necessary to navigate crises.\\nFREE EXERCISE AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY CONCERNS\\n10-4. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution begins \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an\\nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\u2026.\u201d This clause is a constitutional bedrock\\nproviding grounding for religious support and spiritual readiness. The Army values Soldiers\u2019 rights to\\nobserve tenets of their respective religions, or to observe no religion at all. Free exercise of religion supports\\nthe Army mission of sustaining Soldiers\u2019 short- and long-term readiness, building ethical and moral strength,\\nand motivating Soldiers to meet present and future challenges.\\n8 October 2020 FM 7-22, C1 10-1Chapter 10\\n10-5. The word \u2018accommodation\u2019 describes whether the Army and its commanders will prohibit, or permit\\nand accommodate, particular desired exercise or expression of religion that would otherwise be at odds with\\nother military requirements, objectives, and policies. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act generally\\nprovides that a request for religious accommodation from a military policy, practice, or duty that hinders a\\nService member\u2019s exercise of religion may be denied only when the military policy, practice, or duty furthers\\na compelling governmental interest, and is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling\\ngovernmental interest. Leaders grant or deny accommodations according to specific procedures and\\ndirectives such as those laid out in DODI 1300.17 and AR 600-20. Accommodation policy provides further\\nsupport for Army leaders making ample allowance for individual practice of religious exercise in the Army\\nworkplace to support spiritual readiness.\\nESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE AND PLURALISTIC CONCERNS\\n10-6. The Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment act as guideposts for developing\\nspiritual readiness. The Establishment Clause prohibits unfair use of governmental authority, force, or\\ninfluence to mandate or unduly promote any particular form of religion, religious belief, or practice.\\n10-7. Religion may be described as a set of beliefs concerning a divine or transcendent cause, nature, and\\npurpose of the universe typically accompanied with devotional and ritual observances along with an\\naccompanying moral code governing the conduct of human affairs. (See ATP 1-05.03 and ATP 1-05.04 for\\nmore on religion.) Most Army professionals identify with some form of religious belief underlying the\\nspiritual dimension. Since religion is often the most important factor in individual moral outlook and\\nmotivation, leaders must respect religious and spiritual beliefs to develop spiritual readiness appropriately in\\nArmy organizations. Leaders accommodate diverse religious and spiritual practices but do not apply undue\\ninfluence, coerce, or harass subordinates about religion.\\n10-8. Pluralistic concerns represented by the Establishment Clause are reinforced in other mandates of law\\nand policy. Civil rights and equal opportunity law and policy undergird an Army commitment to provide\\nequal opportunity and fair treatment for military personnel and Families without regard to race, color, gender,\\nreligion, sexual orientation, or national origin. Army commanders seek to provide environments free of\\nunlawful discrimination and offensive behavior to those categories (addressed in AR 600-20). Similarly,\\nDODD 5500.07-R requires all Army leaders and Soldiers to \u201cadhere strictly to (this) policy of equal\\nopportunity.\u201d\\nTHE CHAPLAIN CORPS ROLE IN SPIRITUAL READINESS\\n10-9. UMTs and chaplain sections support and advise on spiritual readiness development for both religious\\nand non-religious personnel. Chaplains represent particular faith traditions as religious leaders while serving\\nthe spiritual needs of their assigned units\u2019 Soldiers. Chaplains unable to perform specific religious support\\nneeds due to their own religious commitments provide supplemental religious or spiritual leaders and\\nresources to meet those needs.\\nSPIRITUAL READINESS DEVELOPMENT\\n10-10. Spiritual readiness development involves improving one\u2019s spiritual posture to sustaining one\u2019s self\\nthrough all aspects of life. The improvement process is generally self-directed and informed by religious,\\nphilosophical, or human values forming the basis for character, disposition, decision-making and integrity.\\nWhile individuals approach spiritual readiness from both non-religious and religious perspectives, both\\ncategories creates similar comparative practices.\\nGENERAL SPIRITUAL READINESS PRACTICES\\n10-11. Informed leaders understand the requirements for time, space, materiel, and other conditions\\nrequired to support spiritual readiness practices within particular organizations. Individual spiritual readiness\\nobligations can vary widely. Paragraphs 10-12 through 10-21 provide examples of spiritual readiness\\ndisciplines non-religious and religious personnel both follow. Leaders consult with a chaplain or UMT to\\nregarding these practices.\\n10-2 FM 7-22, C1 8 October 2020+Spiritual Readiness\\nCORPORATE AND INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS\\n10-12. A central practice of spiritual readiness is regular meetings to receive instruction, observe tenets of\\nbelief, and gather with people of similar values. Meetings often occur weekly and can last thirty minutes to\\nseveral hours. Some groups require dedicated sacred space in garrison settings, while other groups require\\ndedicated space free of external distractions. Army chapels are designated as dedicated space for this purpose\\nin both garrison and operational environments. Leaders help subordinates de-conflict operational\\nrequirements and spiritual practices within constraints of operational tempo and mission requirements.\\nSERVICE AND CHARITY\\n10-13. Most spiritual traditions emphasize service to others for the sake of both charity and understanding\\none\u2019s relationship to other human beings and the transcendent. This might involve serving in a homeless\\nshelter, conducting work projects in the local community, visiting the hospital, donating funds or material\\ngoods, or helping people in the unit in need.\\nHOSPITALITY\\n10-14. Hospitality refers to generously receiving and providing a sustaining environment for family,\\nneighbors and strangers. It is a spiritual readiness practice in many traditions. In practicing hospitality, a guest\\nreceives anything from water and shade to lodging, clothing, and food. Closely related to service and charity,\\nthis spiritual readiness practice is more intimate in nature since providing hospitality is in person and\\ngenerally involves engaged social interaction between the host and guest. Many traditions view the practice\\nas a mark of heightened spiritual maturity as it involves vulnerability of the host and investment in another\u2019s\\nwell-being and basic sustenance. The practice of hospitality towards those considered the most vulnerable in\\nsociety includes the orphaned, widowed, homeless, injured, physically handicapped, and prisoners.\\nJOURNALING\\n10-15. Many people use journaling as a spiritual readiness practice. Journaling often involves an individual\\nmaintaining a written record of thoughts, prayers, feelings, beliefs, and reflection on life, philosophy, or other\\nmatters. The journal is either handwritten or digitally recorded. Usually the journal is a private document not\\nintended for disclosure. Journals might also have recorded thoughts and words with no particular association\\nor logic, often referred to as free journaling. Free journaling releases one\u2019s mind to enable focused reflection.\\nJournaling is a means of incorporating cognitive, spiritual, and physical activities as part of an integrated\\napproach to spiritual readiness. Authors might review their journals to gain perspective on life.\\nMEDITATION\\n10-16. Meditation is the practice of contemplation and reflection by an individual or group. It generally\\nrequires few external distractions. For this reason, ensuring a dedicated space away from ongoing training or\\noperations is preferable to facilitate individuals\u2019 ability to practice this spiritual readiness activity.\\nPRAYER AND CHANTING\\n10-17. Religious people tend to practice prayer and chanting to address one or more god, deity, divine being,\\nor spirit. Prayer might follow a set form of words and rhythm or a free-form pattern. Chanting is often a\\nmodified form of prayer or song uttered in a rhythmic manner with or without repetition. Some traditions\\nprescribe prayer according to the time of day, a pattern of prayers using beads, or a specific physical posture\\nassumed during prayer. Some prayer is designed for individuals while other prayers are for groups ranging\\nfrom a few to a large gathering.\\n10-18. Leaders ask subordinates what space, time, and materials they require to facilitate individual prayer\\npractices. Some prayers require preparation in the form of ceremonial washing or fasting. For example,\\nleaders may be asked to provide a dedicated space with ceremonial washing (ablution) capabilities and\\nlimited distractions. Some individuals pray during routine daily activities while others pray only at a\\ndedicated time in a space free from distractions.\\n8 October 2020 FM 7-22, C1 10-3Chapter 10\\nBELIEF (VALUES)-BASED EDUCATION (RELIGIOUS EDUCATION)\\n10-19. Belief-based education occurs for non-religious and religious groups. The education often occurs\\nduring group gatherings, but it also occurs as part of an individual\u2019s study habit. Groups provide times that\\nallow belief-based education to young and more mature adherents. Trained leaders or lay volunteers provide\\ninstruction on topics and information related to core beliefs and the practice of those beliefs. Belief-based\\neducation varies from formal instruction with published curricula and examination to informal tutoring and\\nmentoring. Training may happen throughout the week or as part of a formal education program with group\\nmeetings.\\nBELIEF-BASED READING AND REFLECTION\\n10-20. Non-religious and religious traditions usually reflect on a text, a group of texts, an author, or authors.\\nThese traditions often consider these texts or authors authoritative. Members use them for teaching, learning,\\npersonal reflection, spiritual growth, and normative practices in personal and public life.\\n10-21. Some religious traditions consider the texts sacred. Such texts require reverent and dignified\\nhandling ranging from careful handling, to physical touch only by trained clergy reading the document for\\nadherents. Texts vary in ease of purchase and cost. Texts regarded as sacred often require special storage and\\nhandling considerations. Reading and reflection of spiritual or religious texts varies from one group to\\nanother, with some groups reading these texts on special holy days or in collective gatherings, while other\\ngroups carry paper or digital copies of their texts for daily reading, reflection, or prayer. Some religious\\ngroups require a dedicated space for reading and reflection; other groups might read or listen to their\\nrespective spiritual texts while conducting other activities.\\nRELIGIOUS SPIRITUAL READINESS PRACTICES\\n10-22. Individuals who practice certain spiritual resiliency disciplines tend to identify with a specific\\nreligious group. Paragraphs 10-23 and 1-24 cover the more common disciplines.\\nSACRAMENTS, RITES, AND ORDINANCES\\n10-23. Some religious traditions practice a sacramental understanding that imparts common objects with\\ndivine significance. Often, these traditions follow a rite or ordered pattern when observing sacraments. Those\\npeople with a sacramental understanding often view the objects as sacred or consecrated. Leaders and\\nSoldiers treat those items according to the rites, rituals, or laws of the respective religious tradition. Alongside\\nsacraments and rites are practices by some religious traditions of ordinances. While similar in manner,\\nbelievers do not treat the ordinances as sacred or consecrated. Even so, all people treat those items with\\nappropriate dignity and respect. The practice of sacraments, rites, and ordinances requires specific materials\\nto satisfy that group\u2019s religious requirements. Successful free exercise might require leaders to use\\nappropriated funds to facilitate these spiritual readiness practices.\\nHOLY OR SPECIAL DAY OBSERVANCES\\n10-24. Most religious groups have key dates celebrating significant events by members of that group in\\nindividual, familial, or collective observances. Holy day observances range from a simple group meeting to\\nan elaborate event over several days with specific dietary, travel, and preparation requirements. Each tradition\\nhas a calendar identifying holy day observances. Each calendar varies in whether it is lunar, solar, or\\nGregorian based. Some calendars are set with numerical specificity whereas others are based on conditions\\ninterpreted and defined by religious leaders within that tradition. Some traditions have holy day obligations\\nthat require certain activities for their members as part of the holy day observance. Similar traditions might\\nobserve the same holy day but on a different date. Effective leaders facilitate dialogue and flexibility\\nregarding free exercise of spiritual readiness practices. While special day observances are typically associated\\nwith religious observance, other non-religious spiritual traditions may also have certain special days. Soldiers\\ndesiring to observe special spiritual days plan with leaders in advance.\\n10-4 FM 7-22, C1 8 October 2020+Spiritual Readiness\\nDIETARY PRACTICES\\n10-25. Dietary practices vary widely across religious traditions. Some follow no specific dietary practices\\nwhile other groups might follow stringent dietary regimens synchronized with a religious calendar. The Army\\nplaces a high priority on individual Soldiers\u2019 rights to exercise their religion, to include following religious-\\nbased dietary practices. Each person in a religious group has unique dietary practices. Accordingly, effective\\nleaders engage in open and continued dialogue with subordinates regarding dietary practices so to\\naccommodate the free exercise of religion in this area.\\nCLOTHING AND APPAREL\\n10-26. Spiritual readiness practices can include the wear of religious apparel. Religious accoutrements\\ninclude but are not limited to headgear, tassels, special garments, or rules regarding modest dress. The Army\\nplaces a strong emphasis on facilitating free exercise in the least restrictive manner as possible. See AR 670-1\\nand AR 600-20 for further information on religious accommodation of clothing and apparel.\\nPHYSICAL APPEARANCE\\n10-27. Similar to clothing and apparel, some religious groups require specific practices in regards to hair.\\nThe Army uses an established process for requesting waivers to accommodate free exercise of religion with\\nregard to physical appearance. See AR 670-1 and AR 600-20 for religious accommodations to grooming\\nstandards.\\nSPIRITUAL READINESS ASSESSMENT\\n10-28. Unlike a physical readiness test that assesses established form and repetition of tasks in a set time, a\\nspiritual readiness assessment is subjective and based on self-selection and self-assessment. Paragraph 10-29\\ndescribes sample methods of self-assessment that are not exhaustive in nature, nor intended as authoritative\\nor definitive. Soldiers may freely choose to use assessment tools regarding spiritual readiness without\\nrepercussion or the perception of negative consequences.\\n10-29. Spiritual readiness assessments can come across as artificial, judgmental, rigid, and subjective. For\\nthis reason, each Soldier creates an assessment based on personal aspect and perception of spirituality. For\\nexample, Soldiers who find hope in their own personal achievements when experiencing hardship or\\nadversity, base their assessment on the degree to which achievement is effective in bringing that hope and\\nthereby reinforce their belief in personal achievement. Others who find hope in religious beliefs may base\\ntheir assessments on connection to those beliefs or practices that reinforce those beliefs. Table 10-1 helps\\nSoldiers assessing their own spiritual readiness to focus on relevant factors.\\nTable 10-1.

Several offices, agencies, and individuals have staffs and resources to support leaders and the H2F\\nPerformance Team in facilitating spiritual readiness. Generally, leaders are not expected to be experts on\\nspiritual and religious practices, nor should they function as such. Assistance from qualified staff enables\\nleaders and individuals to focus time and energy on primary Army functions while building and maintaining\\ntheir personal spiritual readiness. The resources listed in paragraphs 10-31 through 10-37 is not exhaustive\\nin nature.\\nCOMMANDERS AND LEADERS\\n10-31. Unit leaders foster spiritual readiness by providing space in schedules, battle rhythms, and training\\nplans for individual self-development to include the spiritual dimension. Unit and organizational leaders can\\nencourage spiritual readiness by discussing the spiritual dimension or spiritual development goals in\\ndevelopmental counseling, individual development plans, or their leadership philosophies. Unit leaders may\\nalso direct spiritual or moral leadership training, often with support from the chaplain section or UMT, to\\nensure contextualized training respects the diversity and pluralistic needs in the unit. (See ATP 1-05.04 for\\nfostering spiritual training.)\\nCHAPLAIN SECTION OR UNIT MINISTRY TEAM\\n10-32. Chaplains and religious affairs specialists are assigned to units down to the battalion level. Called a\\nchaplain section above brigade and the UMT at the brigade and below, chaplains and religious affairs\\nspecialists have specific training and education. They support command requirements to facilitate free\\nexercise of religion and to provide spiritual assistance for all assigned, attached, or authorized personnel. The\\nchaplain section or UMT advises the commander on broad issues regarding religion, morals, ethics, and\\nmorale. A key aspect of this advisement is the ability to conduct research and provide advice and resources\\non spiritual and religious practices. (See FM 1-05 and ATP 1-05.04 for details on religious advisement.)\\nGARRISON CHAPLAIN\u2019S OFFICE\\n10-33. Most installations have a garrison chaplain section assigned to support an installation-wide, senior\\ncommander\u2019s command master religious program. This office is responsible for planning, developing,\\nexecuting, and assessing religious support for the entire installation. As such, this office generally maintains\\nlists of broad spiritual and religious support programs on the installation, engages spiritual leaders to facilitate\\ncomprehensive religious support, and leverages Chaplain Corps assets to research and support spiritual\\nreadiness practice requests for all assigned, attached, or authorized personnel. Garrison chaplain sections\\ntypically include a director of religious education. That individual oversees all religious education\\nrequirements on the installation and supports the garrison chaplain\u2019s research and provision of appropriate\\nsupport for spiritual readiness practices. See AR 165-1 for more information on the garrison chaplain\u2019s office.\\n10-6 FM 7-22, C1 8 October 2020+Spiritual Readiness\\nEQUAL OPPORTUNITY ADVISOR OR OFFICE\\n10-34. Religion is a category covered under the Equal Opportunity Program of the Army. As such, equal\\nopportunity representatives and advisors can assist leaders and individuals with facilitating spiritual readiness\\nwithout discrimination. The equal opportunity advisor or officer can advise on various religious or spiritual\\npractices as well as indicators of a healthy climate in which leaders emphasize spiritual readiness without\\ncreating adversarial or unhealthy conditions within a unit.\\nARMY FIT WEBSITE\\n10-35. The Army currently maintains the Army Fit website (https://armyfit.army.mil) that provides\\nresources for teams, leaders, and individuals. The resources cover five dimensions: physical, emotional,\\nsocial, spiritual, and family. There are articles under the spiritual dimension that provide insights into various\\nspiritual readiness practices as well as discussions of potential obstacles or challenges an individual might\\nexperience in the exercise of a particular spiritual readiness practice.\\nLOCAL ORGANIZATIONS\\n10-36. In the immediate area surrounding military installations, several civilian religious and secular\\norganizations often provide spiritual readiness education and direction. Leaders seeking information\\nregarding spiritual readiness practices of their subordinates or looking for places to refer subordinates looking\\nfor specific spiritual advisement and practices might benefit from contacting these organizations. The\\nchaplain section or UMT maintains a list of various local organizations to facilitate ease of referral.\\nMaintaining these diverse lists does not constitute official government endorsement of any particular\\norganization, but rather as a way to aid individual spiritual development.\\nINTERNALLY ASSIGNED ASSETS\\n10-37. Spiritual or religious practices of Soldiers and their Family members are diverse and often represent\\na cross-sectional demographic of the U.S. population. As such, leaders can benefit from learning about\\nrespective spiritual or religious groups from assigned Soldiers and their Family members. Those who practice\\na particular spiritual or religious tradition often understand nuances within that tradition. Providing regular\\nopportunities for these individuals to provide information on their respective spiritual beliefs, practices, and\\ncustoms can create a climate of understanding, dignity, and respect. Such classes also provide an opportunity\\nfor Soldiers to develop professional briefing and teaching skills. Identifying individuals in the unit who\\nexercise a specific spiritual or religious tradition can prove beneficial for supporting other members of the\\nteam in a time of crisis or stress.\\nSummary\\nSpiritual readiness is a vital domain in the H2F System, and it directly impacts the\\nresiliency of individuals and organizations. Encouraging Soldiers to connect and reflect\\non the worldview or value system that informs their core beliefs, principles, ethics, and\\nmorals can empower them to endure and overcome stress, hardship, and tragedy.\\nLeaders have a responsibility to support spiritual readiness practices and create a\\nclimate where dignity and respect guide the process. Understanding common spiritual\\nreadiness practices enables leaders to support individual spiritual readiness\\ndevelopment, sustainment, maintenance, and repair.\\n8 October 2020 FM 7-22, C1 10-7This page intentionally left blank.Chapter 11\\nSleep Readiness\\nThe brain is the only organ or body part that requires sleep. Sleep is crucial for tissue\\nrepair and hormone synthesis to maintain peak performance mentally and physically.\\nSleep sustains brain and physical health, cognition, the immune system, and recovery\\nafter physical activity. This chapter provides tools and techniques for leaders and\\nindividuals exercising sleep readiness tactics, techniques, and procedures for a range\\nof occupations and operational environments.\\nPRINCIPLES\\n11-1. There are three basic interrelated principles of sleep health: sleep duration, sleep timing, and sleep\\ncontinuity. Of these, sleep duration is paramount because the health and functioning of the brain is primarily\\na direct function of the amount of sleep obtained\u2014the more sleep obtained the better. Sleep timing is critical\\nbecause the brain\u2019s internal clock strongly influences the ability to initiate and maintain sleep as well as\\nmaximize the amount of sleep obtained. The extent to which sleep is undisturbed by arousals and\\nawakenings\u2014sleep continuity\u2014is important because this influences both the duration and the depth of sleep,\\nwith deeper sleep being more restorative. Ultimately, the promotion of sleep health in the operational\\nenvironment entails optimizing each Soldier\u2019s sleep duration, timing, and continuity to the greatest extent\\npossible, given existing mission constraints. See ATP 7-22.01 for H2F testing and ATP 7-22.02 for drills and\\nexercises. See also ATP 6-22.5 for further discussion on the leader\u2019s role in sleep readiness.\\nSLEEP DURATION\\n11-2. Cognitive ability and readiness vary as direct function of the amount of sleep obtained. The more sleep\\nSoldiers get, the greater their mental acuity, with faster response times, fewer errors, and fewer lapses in\\nattention. Also improved are judgment, problem-solving, situational awareness, mood, resilience, and general\\nwell-being\u2014to name but a few key Soldier attributes.\\n11-3. Soldiers and leaders frequently ask \u201cwhat is the minimum amount of sleep needed to maintain military\\neffectiveness?\u201d There is no clear threshold amount of sleep below which effectiveness is compromised and\\nabove which effectiveness is sustained. Most Soldiers need 7 to 9 hours of sleep every 24 hours to maximize\\nhealth and sustain performance. The relationship between sleep duration and cognitive readiness (and thus,\\nmilitary effectiveness) is best thought of as a continuum, with more sleep always producing improved\\nperformance. Considered this way, the question becomes: \u201cHow can the amount of sleep obtained by Soldiers\\nbe maximized, given the constraints imposed by the current mission?\u201d\\nSLEEP TIMING\\n11-4. Human beings are diurnal, designed to be awake during the daytime and to sleep during the nighttime.\\nA portion of the brain that serves as an internal clock\u2014sensitive to the timing of sunrise in the morning and\\nsunset in the evening\u2014largely controls these sleep-wake tendencies. This sensitivity keeps the brain\u2019s clock\\nsynchronized with the outside world. During those hours that the brain\u2019s clock has learned are local daytime\\nhours, the brain produces output that facilitates activity and wakefulness. During those hours that the brain\u2019s\\nclock has learned are nighttime hours, it signals brain deactivation, thus promoting sleep. People who work\\nat night might be less productive and less well-rested since they work when their brains promote sleep; and\\nthey try to sleep when their brains promote wakefulness. Likewise, this is what causes \u201cjet lag.\u201d After rapidly\\ncrossing multiple time zones, the brain\u2019s internal clock is initially out of synch with the local day-night cycle,\\nsending out signals to promote sleep during daylight hours and sending out signals to promote wakefulness\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 11-1Chapter 11\\nduring the nighttime hours. Normal sleep and alertness are typically not restored in the jet-lagged brain for\\nseveral days\u2014the time it takes for the brain\u2019s internal clock to resynchronize to the day-night cycle of the\\nnew, local time zone. (See paragraphs 11-34 through 11-54 for strategies to mitigate the effects of disruptions\\nin normal sleep patterns.)\\n11-5. Maintaining a consistent sleep-wake schedule on both duty and non-duty days has the benefit of\\nstrengthening and reinforcing the internal wake- and sleep-promoting processes controlled by the brain\u2019s\\ninternal clock. These processes constitute the \u201ccircadian rhythm of alertness.\u201d Individuals who maintain\\nconsistent sleep-wake schedules (especially on arising at the same time each morning and experience their\\nfirst exposure to daylight at the same time each day) derive the maximum benefits from the circadian rhythm\\nof alertness, with well-consolidated sleep at night and optimum alertness during the daytime. A consistent\\nand regimented schedule of sleep- and wake-related activities helps to lock in other biological systems\\nassociated with circadian rhythms. These include hormone release, digestion, muscle strength, and\\ncardiovascular performance. Circadian rhythms act in tandem with the need to sleep which builds throughout\\na day. These rhythms optimize the process of falling asleep, staying asleep, and ensuring quality sleep.\\n11-6. However, Soldiers can only achieve such benefits if they get adequate sleep (for most individuals, 7 to\\n9 hours of sleep per night) on a regular basis. If they get less sleep (for example, 6 hours per night during the\\nduty week), then a \u201csleep debt\u201d accrues. In such cases, it is better to sleep in on off-duty days and pay down\\nthe sleep debt, rather than sacrificing sleep to try to maintain a consistent sleep-wake schedule and strengthen\\nthe circadian rhythm of alertness.\\n11-7. Although the circadian rhythm of alertness generally promotes a 24-hour cycle of daytime wakefulness\\nand nighttime sleep, there is also a temporary afternoon \u201cdip\u201d in alertness. This dip becomes especially\\nnoticeable in individuals who have a significant sleep debt (for example, not regularly obtaining adequate\\nsleep). For those able to take advantage of it, the afternoon dip provides an opportunity for obtaining good\\nquality daytime sleep to help pay down any existing sleep debt. Soldiers can generally take these naps without\\nsignificantly disrupting the circadian rhythm of alertness\u2014provided that the naps are not so long or so\\nfrequent that they begin to impair the ability to initiate sleep at night.\\nSLEEP CONTINUITY\\n11-8. The restorative value of sleep is determined not only by the duration of the sleep period, but also by\\nthe continuity of the sleep period\u2014that is, the extent to which the sleep period is continuous and\\nuninterrupted. The sleeping brain cycles through non-rapid eye movement (known as NREM) and rapid eye\\nmovement sleep (known as REM or \u201cdreaming sleep\u201d) every 90\u2013120 minutes. The full benefit of sleep occurs\\nwhen the brain completes 4\u20135 complete cycles. Non-rapid eye movement sleep makes up most of the first\\nhalf of the night\u2019s sleep. During this type of sleep, the body releases hormones that help repair and rebuild\\nmuscles and replenish energy. There are three stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep: stage 1 (the lightest\\nsleep stage), stage 2 (which accounts for approximately 50 percent of nighttime sleep), and stage 3 (the\\ndeepest and the most recuperative sleep stage). During sleep, the body clears toxins that have accumulated\\nthroughout the day (as by-products of healthy brain functioning) from the brain; it also fixes and transforms\\nnew memories into usable knowledge. Both types of sleep are essential, and it is important that the brain\\ncycles appropriately between non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement sleep across the night. When\\nsleep is interrupted or shortened, natural progression of sleep cycles are disturbed reducing the beneficial\\neffects of the sleep.\\nSLEEP READINESS FUNDAMENTALS\\n11-9. Like the rest of the body (for example, muscles, skin, and liver), the brain has physiological needs for\\nfood, water, and oxygen\u2014basic needs that must be met not only to ensure proper brain functioning, but to\\nsustain life itself. However, unlike the rest of the body, the brain has one additional physiological need: sleep.\\nThe brain requires sleep to maintain normal function. Sleep is necessary to sustain not only alertness, but\\nalso higher order cognitive abilities such as judgment, decision making, and situational awareness. In short,\\nsleep makes Soldiers better at being Soldiers.\\n11-10. The brain needs sleep to restore and repair itself, to work efficiently, to fix new memories, and to\\nprocess new information appropriately. Sleep also clears away waste products from normal breakdown of\\n11-2 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Sleep Readiness\\nchemicals that accumulate in the brain during wakefulness. Prioritizing sleep, and ensuring that opportunities\\nfor Soldier sleep are maximized in all operational environments, serves to optimize brain, psychological, and\\nimmunological health. In particular, sleeping properly before training improves attention, understanding, and\\nlearning. Sleeping properly after training improves the ability to both remember and appropriately utilize\\nnewly-acquired skills and information.\\n11-11. Although some Soldiers may require a little more or a little less sleep, for the vast majority of\\nSoldiers a steady diet of 7\u20138 hours of sleep every 24 hours is needed to sustain normal levels of brain function\\nand health indefinitely. Most Soldiers who regularly obtain less than 7\u20138 hours of sleep every 24 hours pay\\na price: they unwittingly but steadily accrue a significant sleep debt, characterized by increasingly suboptimal\\nalertness, reduced mental sharpness, and an impaired ability to recover from stress. These Soldiers typically\\nbelieve that they are fine and may perform most basic duties adequately. From an objective standpoint, their\\nalertness and mental acuity is significantly (and invariably) impaired. As a rule of thumb, any Soldier who\\nsleeps two or more hours longer on days off (versus duty days) carries a significant sleep debt.\\n11-12. Even for those who regularly obtain the generally recommended 7\u20138 hours of sleep per night, more\\nsleep can result in even better alertness and mental acuity. In brain health and mental functioning, there is no\\nsuch thing as too much sleep. Therefore, to maximize brain health and functioning in an operational\\nenvironment, Soldiers aim to maximize sleep as much as possible within the constraints of the operation. As\\nsleep duration increases, so does the likelihood of mission success.\\n11-13. Insufficient sleep degrades the brain\u2019s function. The more sleep the brain gets, the better it functions.\\nThe effects of inadequate sleep on brain function and performance are well-documented:\\n\\uf06c Reduced ability to concentrate, impaired judgment, problem solving and decision making.\\n\\uf06c Increased irritability and reduced mood.\\n\\uf06c Reduced motivation level.\\n\\uf06c Increased reaction time and slowed response time.\\n\\uf06c Reduced ability to effectively cope with stress.\\n\\uf06c Increased risk of physical injury.\\n\\uf06c Increased time to recover from injury.\\n11-14. Insufficient sleep negatively affects not only cognitive performance, but emotional and social\\nfunctioning. Adequate sleep promotes an optimistic outlook and social acuity, but failure to obtain adequate\\nsleep on a regular basis (for example, being chronically sleep restricted) makes a person less resilient to stress\\nand stress-related disorders including posttraumatic stress and depression.\\n11-15. If the brain is starved of sleep for long enough, it will eventually fall asleep. Although severe\\nsleepiness can be staved off momentarily by increasing environmental stimulation (for example, increasing\\nthe volume on the radio, opening a car window, getting up and walking around), no amount of effort or\\nwillpower will maintain wakefulness for long. Humans cannot resist the need for sleep any more than the\\nneed for air. In much the same way that it is impossible to hold one\u2019s breath until consciousness is lost, it is\\nlikewise impossible for the sleep-starved individual to resist sleep onset. At some point, the sleepy brain will\\nslip into sleep, regardless of any and all efforts to avoid it. Sleep onset under such conditions is not a voluntary\\nact. Therefore, severe sleepiness is dangerous not only to the sleepy individuals, but also to people around\\nthem. Severe sleepiness proves more dangerous when individuals engage in monotonous activities such as\\ndriving, pulling security, or monitoring equipment or computer screens.\\n11-16. In short, the brain has a physiological need for sleep, and sleep promotes and sustains the ability to\\nthink and maintain mental toughness. And the more sleep, the better. Although obtaining 7 to 9 hours of\\nnightly sleep generally results in the ability to sustain normal levels of alertness and performance during the\\ndaytime, obtaining even more sleep results in greater brain readiness\u2014enhanced mental sharpness and\\nresilience in the field.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 11-3Chapter 11\\nPROMOTING HEALTHY SLEEP\\n11-17. Good sleep is essential for optimal performance and readiness. Factors to consider when optimizing\\nsleep duration and continuity include: the sleep environment, a pre-sleep routine, and a sleep schedule that\\nconforms as closely as possible to the brain\u2019s natural circadian rhythm of alertness.\\nSLEEP ENVIRONMENT\\n11-18. Sleep duration and continuity are optimized in environments that are quiet, dark, and maintained at\\na comfortable ambient temperature. Some individuals believe that they sleep better with music or a television\\non, that they can sleep anywhere, and that ambient noise does not bother them. Research clearly shows that\\nthis is not the case. Soldiers do not get good sleep on a cot in the tactical operations center. Although sleepers\\nare not aware of it, environmental sounds cause brief arousals\u2014a momentary speeding of the brain\u2019s electro-\\nencephalograph (known as EEG) activity during sleep\u2014that effectively disrupt sleep continuity and reduce\\nthe restorative value of that sleep. Likewise, bright lights and excessively hot or cold environments can\\ndisrupt sleep continuity and reduce the restorative value of sleep.\\nPRE-SLEEP ROUTINE\\n11-19. Stress is incompatible with sleep. Pre-sleep routines that promote winding down\u2014such as listening\\nto soothing music, reading, or taking a warm shower or bath\u201430\u201360 minutes prior to bedtime tend to\\nfacilitate the transition to sleep. These routines will maximize sleep duration. Conversely, activities such as\\nwatching television, playing video games, chatting online, and similar interesting or engaging activities tend\\nto arouse the brain and delay sleep onset. These activities reduce the amount of sleep obtained and should be\\navoided during the pre-sleep wind-down period. Tobacco product use is also antithetical to sleep. People\\nsmoke before sleep to wind down. The stimulant in nicotine tells the body to get active while it increases\\nheart rate and alertness. Those experiencing significant stress often find relaxation techniques such as\\nmeditation and mindfulness exercises helpful.\\nSLEEP SCHEDULE\\n11-20. Adequate performance is best achieved by Soldiers who consistently get adequate sleep (7\u20138 hours)\\non a nighttime sleep-daytime wakefulness schedule aligned with the brain\u2019s natural circadian rhythm of\\nalertness. Both sleep duration and sleep continuity are maximized on such schedules. However, military\\noperations are often continuous (24-hours per day) and influenced by random and unpredictable events and\\nrequirements. Shift work is unavoidable for at least some deployed Soldiers, and sleep opportunities are\\nsometimes unpredictable for virtually all deployed Soldiers. The following situations commonly contribute\\nto sleep loss and decrements in waking performance:\\n\\uf06c Shift work.\\n\\uf06c Changing schedules.\\n\\uf06c Social jet lag.\\nSHIFT WORK\\n11-21. The human brain is biologically hard-wired to be alert during the daylight hours and asleep during\\nthe nighttime and early morning hours. Because of this, poor quality sleep results from night shift work even\\nwhen shift workers spend adequate time (approximately 8\u20139 hours) in bed during the daytime. Although such\\na schedule is unnatural for the human brain, some adaptation to a nighttime-awake and daytime-asleep\\nschedule does occur over time, but such adaptation is never complete. Soldiers always pay a cost in their\\nwaking performance and daytime sleep quality. This occurs even when working consistent, steady nights. In\\nthe long term, Soldiers associate frequent shift work with weight gain and increased risks for diabetes, fatty\\nliver disease, and cardiovascular disease. See discussions beginning in paragraphs 11-24 and 11-30 for\\nstrategies to mitigate adverse effects of shift work.\\n11-4 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Sleep Readiness\\nCHANGING SCHEDULES\\n11-22. Rapidly changing and backward shifting work-rest (duty) schedules exacerbate the problem. Leaders\\nshould always aim to optimize the Soldier\u2019s sleep to the extent possible given the existing operational\\nconstraints. Toward this end, commanders consider the following two principles:\\n\\uf06c Strive for consistency for individual Soldiers by rotating shifts no more often than twice per\\nmonth.\\n\\uf06c Always rotate shifts in a forward direction.\\nThese actions allows sleep to occur later on the new shift than it did on the old shift. Bodies have more\\ndifficulty adapting to backward shift rotations because that requires earlier initiation of the sleep period. This\\nis also why it is easier to adapt to a new time zone (jet lag symptoms are less severe) following westward\\ntravel across multiple time zones versus eastward travel. It is easier to stay up a little later and sleep in than\\nto go to bed earlier and arise earlier in a new time zone. See discussions beginning in paragraphs 11-24 and\\n11-30 for strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of changing schedules.\\nSOCIAL JET LAG\\n11-23. The tendency to stay up later and sleep in later on off-duty days (often the weekends when in\\ngarrison) commonly results in a phenomenon known as social jet lag. This state of mild sleep restriction\\nresults from the subsequent need to arise earlier on the first day back to work (for example, Monday following\\na weekend off). The effect resembles that experienced by individuals who experience jet lag after traveling\\neastward across a couple of time zones.\\nLEADERSHIP\u2019S ROLE\\n11-24. While good leadership is essential for a wide range of unit outcomes, leadership behaviors that target\\nsleep can improve the sleep habits of unit members and the unit\u2019s overall sleep culture. Sleep leadership\\nbehavior includes promotion of sleep awareness and the development and implementation of local policies\\nthat facilitate the ability of subordinates to practice good sleep hygiene. An example of sleep awareness is\\nensuring that subordinates understand the importance of sleep for health and readiness, as well as the negative\\nconsequences of sleep loss. Such practices (for example, moving physical readiness training from morning\\nto the afternoon or starting the duty day later, both of which allow Soldiers to sleep later) result in improved\\nsubordinate sleep, enhanced health (reduced sick call and accident rates), and improved unit climate. The\\nacronym SLEEP represents the following basic sleep leadership practices:\\n\\uf06c Set conditions.\\n\\uf06c Lead by example.\\n\\uf06c Educate and encourage.\\n\\uf06c Prioritize and plan.\\nSET CONDITIONS\\n11-25. The S stands for set conditions. Leaders set conditions when they\u2014\\n\\uf06c Strive to create an optimal sleep environment by controlling noise, light, and temperature.\\n\\uf06c Address work-related and other sources of stress for Soldiers that may be interfering with sleep.\\n\\uf06c Implement duty schedules that optimize nighttime sleep and daytime alertness.\\nLEAD BY EXAMPLE\\n11-26. The L stands for lead by example. Leaders lead by example when they\u2014\\n\\uf06c Serve as role models for subordinates by demonstrating good sleep habits and maintaining healthy\\nwork-rest schedule.\\n\\uf06c Look for opportunities to show they consider sleep to be a priority for unit. For example,\\nemphasize sleep in remarks during Recovery Drills or other unit formations and functions.\\n\\uf06c Remind Soldiers of the importance of sleep.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 11-5Chapter 11\\nEDUCATE AND ENCOURAGE\\n11-27. The E stands for educate and encourage. Leaders educate when they\u2014\\n\\uf06c Establish a good sleep culture in the unit and ensure that subordinate leaders are also engaging in\\ngood sleep leadership.\\n\\uf06c Encourage Soldiers to look for signs of sleep problems regularly.\\n\\uf06c Ensure all Soldiers have access to information on effective sleep habits.\\n\\uf06c Give Soldiers permission to nap when circumstances allow, and encourage naps when appropriate,\\nespecially during continuous operations.\\nPRIORITIZE AND PLAN\\n11-28. The P stands for prioritize and plan. Leaders do this when they\u2014\\n\\uf06c Ensure Soldiers have enough time to attend to their personal matters while still getting sufficient\\nsleep.\\n\\uf06c Are aware of the challenges of shift work and continuous operations, and implement schedules\\nthat mitigate their negative effects on performance and health.\\n\\uf06c Think of sleep as an item of logistical resupply, like beans and bullets, and plan accordingly. That\\nis, schedule enough time for Soldiers to get sufficient (or even extra) sleep before\u2014and recovery\\nsleep after\u2014all missions.\\n\\uf06c Consider having Soldiers perform less complex tasks in the early morning before 0900 and more\\ncomplex tasks in the late morning and early afternoon.\\n11-29. Sleep is essential to health and readiness. To optimize Soldiers\u2019 alertness and performance, leaders\\nmaintain as consistent and regimented a sleep-wake schedule as possible (optimize sleep timing) with an\\nadequate amount of sleep opportunity (optimize sleep duration). Leaders also ensure that the sleep-wake\\nschedule conforms as closely as possible to the brain\u2019s natural circadian rhythm to optimize both duration\\nand quality of sleep.\\nPLANNING FOR PERIODS OF INSUFFICIENT SLEEP\\n11-30. Effective leaders consider sleep an item of logistical resupply like water, food, fuel, and ammunition.\\nPlanning for sleep in training and tactical environments is a leader competency. Sleep management optimizes\\nSoldiers\u2019 performance in austere conditions. Sleep is a force multiplier. In healthy persons, there is no such\\nthing as too much sleep. The goal in all operational scenarios should always be to maximize sleep duration\\nbecause more sleep always results in greater alertness, resilience, and mental acuity\u2014greater readiness.\\nOVERALL STRATEGY\\n11-31. When mission requirements do not allow for adequate sleep, the goal becomes twofold: to optimize\\nalertness and performance during waking periods to the extent possible and to maximize the ability of\\nSoldiers to take advantage of any opportunities for sleep that do occur. Factors that determine the extent to\\nwhich alertness and performance are impacted by sleep loss include:\\n\\uf06c Individual differences in sensitivity and resistance to the effects of sleep loss.\\n\\uf06c Individual sleep history\u2014those who habitually sleep more tend to be more resistant to sleep loss.\\n\\uf06c Length of continued wakefulness\u2014the longer the period of sleep loss, the worse the performance.\\n\\uf06c Time of day or night\u2014the brain\u2019s circadian rhythm of alertness exacerbates the effects of sleep\\nloss during the early morning hours, and partially mitigates the effects of sleep loss during the\\ndaytime or early evening hours.\\nINDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES\\n11-32. No one can maintain alertness and performance indefinitely without sleep, but some individuals are\\nmore impacted by sleep loss than others. Individual differences are determined by both genetics and sleep\\nhistory or habitual sleep duration. A Soldier\u2019s sensitivity versus resistance to the effects of sleep loss cannot\\n11-6 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Sleep Readiness\\nbe predicted before the fact; therefore, leaders need to objectively measure a Soldier\u2019s performance since\\ninsufficient sleep impairs the ability to self-assess. As a rule, sleep-deprived Soldiers will overestimate their\\nown capabilities. Leaders should expect and plan not only for reduced performance, but increasing variability\\nin the effectiveness of Soldiers who have increased sleep loss.\\nTIME OF DAY OR NIGHT\\n11-33. The brain\u2019s internal sleepiness-alertness cycle directly impacts performance. Because of this, work\\nperformed between 2300 and 0800 hours is generally less efficient (slower and with a greater number of\\nerrors) than work performed during the daytime and early evening hours. Leaders should anticipate reduced\\nlevels of productivity and effectiveness during these hours.\\nJET LAG, SHIFT WORK, AND MISSIONS\\n11-34. Jet lag and shift work tend to result in misalignment of the circadian rhythm. Crossing multiple time\\nzones tends to result in jet lag and impacts a Soldier\u2019s ability to adjust to the time zone and obtain needed\\nsleep. In jet lag, circadian misalignment results from the inability of the brain\u2019s internal clock to rapidly adapt\\nto a new time zone. In shift work, circadian misalignment results from shifting the wake period to that portion\\nof the night when sleep typically occurs and shifting the sleep period to the daytime when the brain is primed\\nfor wakefulness.\\n11-35. Following travel across multiple time zones, re-adaptation can take from 3\u20134 days to several weeks\\ndepending on individual differences in adaptability that are determined by factors such as age and genetics.\\nHowever, realignment of the internal clock with the new environment does not occur linearly. The greatest\\ndaytime deficits in alertness and performance and the most severe nighttime sleep disturbances tend to occur\\nduring the first 24 hours in the new time zone. These issues tend to be resolved in the first 3 or 4 days in a\\nnew time zone, at which point the brain\u2019s clock will typically have made significant progress in resetting\\nitself to the local day-night schedule.\\n11-36. The brain\u2019s clock can more easily adapt to westward travel (to stay up later at night and sleep in\\nlonger in the morning) than to eastward travel (to go to bed earlier and arise earlier). For the same reason, it\\nis easier for the brain to adapt to a forward rotating shift schedule (transitioning from the day shift to the\\nevening shift to the midnight shift) than to a backward rotating shift schedule (transitioning from the midnight\\nshift to the evening shift to the day shift). The greatest impacts from circadian misalignment seen in jet lag\\nand shift work are sleep disturbance, deficits in self-assessment, risk of errors and accidents, and degradation\\nof efficiency and productivity.\\n11-37. The following strategies assist Soldiers coping with jet lag, shift work, and operational missions:\\n\\uf06c Before travel.\\n\\uf06c During travel.\\n\\uf06c After travel.\\n\\uf06c Before missions.\\n\\uf06c During missions.\\n\\uf06c After missions.\\n\\uf06c Continuous operations.\\nBefore Travel\\n11-38. Up to two weeks prior to traveling, Soldiers pay down sleep debt and bank sleep by getting 8 or\\nmore hours of sleep per night. They do not attempt to pre-adapt to a new time zone. Attempting to pre-adapt\\nby moving sleep-wake timing forward or backward is difficult to accomplish and can cause a sleep debt.\\nDuring Travel\\n11-39. Transcontinental flights east are generally scheduled for evening departure, allowing for in-flight\\nsleep during periods of minimal alertness. Transcontinental westward flights are generally scheduled for\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 11-7Chapter 11\\nmorning departure when it may be difficult to fall asleep, but long-duration flights afford the opportunity for\\nafternoon sleep. The following tactics support in-flight sleep:\\n\\uf06c Stop caffeine intake 6 hours prior to take-off. Do not drink caffeine until approximately 30 minutes\\nbefore landing.\\n\\uf06c Eat a meal prior to boarding or immediately after take-off. Forego any later in-flight meal service\\nthat will interfere with your sleep.\\n\\uf06c Do not consume alcohol before or during the flight. Alcohol will make you feel drowsy, but it\\nactually impairs sleep.\\n\\uf06c Control effects of cabin noise, light, and temperature by using foam ear plugs (or noise-cancelling\\nheadphones), a sleep mask, and blanket. Select a window seat so that passenger and flight\\nattendant movements do not disrupt your sleep.\\nAfter Travel\\n11-40. Adjust activities in new time zone based on the following guidance:\\n\\uf06c Schedule meetings during routine alertness cycle and avoid meetings during your routine sleep\\ncycle.\\n\\uf06c Use 200 milligrams of caffeine (equivalent to two cups of coffee) prior to critical meetings to\\nsupport alertness and mental acuity. Stop caffeine at least 6 hours prior to a scheduled sleep period.\\n\\uf06c For fast turn-around travel (1\u20132 days at each time zone), maintain home time schedule as much as\\npossible. Schedule critical meetings during peak alertness. For eastward travel, this means\\nscheduling meetings to occur in the late afternoon or evening of the new local time. Sleep or nap\\nduring the new local day.\\n\\uf06c Avoid alcohol since it exacerbates sleepiness and mental deficits as well as impairs sleep.\\n\\uf06c Use sleep-inducing agents only under a physician\u2019s supervision and approval.\\n\\uf06c Avoid over-the-counter sleep aids. These compounds do not improve sleep and they can impair\\npost-awakening alertness and mental acuity.\\n\\uf06c Avoid over-the-counter melatonin (marketed as a sleep aid) since it does not increase actual sleep\\ntime.\\n\\uf06c Manage light exposure depending on the alertness boost needed. Some sources of light found in\\noffices and hotels boost alertness. While this exposure may be useful to boost alertness, it may\\nalso lead to poor sleep quality and duration.\\n\\uf06c Make the computer\u2019s display adapt to the time of day and use the blue light blocker during non-\\ndaylight hours to facilitate nighttime sleep and strengthen circadian rhythms.\\n\\uf06c Be aware of sunrise and sunset times to determine bed time. Go to bed when the sun goes down.\\nBe active and move around when the sun is up. Use naps to achieve 7\u20138 hours of sleep every 24\\nhours. Naps will improve alertness and performance.\\nBefore Missions\\n11-41. The notion that one can adapt to sleep loss is a myth. Although Soldiers generally benefit from\\ntraining as they fight, this does not hold true for sleep loss. Soldiers cannot be trained to perform better on\\nless sleep. Although chronically sleep-restricted Soldiers do become accustomed to a reduced level of\\nalertness, which they think is normal, objective assessments to reveal deficits show that there is no evidence\\nof habituation or adaptation to sleep loss. The only possible benefit to training under conditions of sleep loss\\nis if it increases the Soldiers\u2019 awareness and appreciation for the extent to which sleep loss impacts their\\nphysical and mental abilities. See table 11-1 for strategies to maximize mission sleep.\\n11-42. Although Soldiers cannot train to perform better on less sleep, they can bank sleep. Sleep banking\\nis achieved by significantly extending the nightly time in bed to more than 8 hours per night. Soldiers must\\nbank sleep for multiple consecutive nights prior to embarking on a mission that is likely to result in inadequate\\nsleep. The extra sleep they obtain in this manner creates a bank of sleep they use to sustain alertness and\\nperformance during subsequent sleep loss (acute sleep deprivation or chronic sleep restriction).\\n11-8 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Sleep Readiness\\nTable 11-1. Maximizing mission sleep\\nBefore\\nTwo weeks prior, get 8 or more hours of sleep per night.\\nStop caffeine and alcohol consumption at least 6 hours prior to scheduled sleep.\\nDuring\\nTake naps whenever possible to accumulate 7-8 hours of sleep in every 24 hour period.\\nCaffeine can be used to reduce grogginess on awakening.\\nSeparate day and night shift sleep areas.\\nAfter\\nTo reduce sleep debt or deprivation, plan on additional sleep time.\\nIncrease sleep to 8 hours every 24 hours to return to optimal alertness and performance.\\n11-43. Importantly, the benefits of sleep banking are not limited just to the following day; such benefits\\nhave been shown to remain evident over days and weeks, and may last even longer. This is because the brain\\nsaves (or banks) sleep that it does not use the next day, and it expends that sleep during future periods of\\nsleep loss. Increasing the amount of sleep prior to a mission improves performance during that mission and,\\nas a bonus, reduces the amount of sleep subsequently needed to recover from that mission. When possible,\\nleaders should provide Soldiers the opportunity for extended sleep (10 hours in bed per night may be optimal)\\nfor several consecutive nights (for at least one week, if possible) prior to missions likely to involve significant\\nsleep loss. Leaders should encourage Soldiers to take appropriate advantage of this opportunity for extra\\nsleep. Soldiers best accomplish sleep extension by going to bed earlier (rather than staying in bed later)\\nbecause awakening at the same time each morning helps to sustain and strengthen the brain\u2019s circadian\\nrhythm of alertness.\\nDuring Missions\\n11-44. Properly planned sleep management strategies facilitate alertness and performance in any\\noperational scenario. They can make the difference between mission success and failure during continuous\\noperations when the stakes are high and opportunities for sleep are restricted. The ultimate goal of these\\nstrategies is to maximize unit readiness and lethality.\\n11-45. Two complementary approaches optimize Soldier alertness and effectiveness during continuous and\\nsustained operations when they have little or no opportunity for sleep. The first (and most effective) approach\\nis to optimize sleep itself, to the maximum extent is possible to do so given operational constraints. Nothing\\nis better, in the short- or long-term, at preventing or reversing the effects of sleep loss than sleep itself. The\\nsecond approach is to directly facilitate alertness in the sleep-deprived Soldier by using a stimulant such as\\ncaffeine. This has to be done in a way that minimizes the counterproductive effects of the stimulant on the\\nSoldiers\u2019 ability to take advantage of whatever limited opportunities for sleep may arise during the mission.\\n11-46. The short- and long-term goals of the first approach is to maximize sleep duration and continuity\u2014\\nan approach that primarily entails optimization of work-rest schedules and optimization of the sleep\\nenvironment. The second approach aims to optimize alertness and performance directly with caffeine, albeit\\nin a manner that minimizes the negative effects of the caffeine on sleep duration and continuity.\\nAfter Missions\\n11-47. The longer an individual goes without sleep, the greater the decline in cognitive performance, and\\nthe longer it will take to recover from the sleep debt that has accrued. In general, it takes longer to recover\\nfrom chronic sleep restriction (several nights of inadequate sleep) than it takes to recover from a comparable\\nlevel of acute total sleep deprivation (a single period of extended wakefulness). While it is difficult to predict\\nprecisely the amount of recovery sleep required by each individual, the goal should always be to maximize\\nthe opportunity for recovery sleep following any mission that results in sleep loss.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 11-9Chapter 11\\nContinuous (24-hour) Operations\\n11-48. Continuous military operations are a mainstay of the Army. Soldiers must be prepared to conduct\\noperations for extended periods with limited rest and sleep deprivation to accomplish the mission. Paragraphs\\n11-49 through 11-54 describes proven techniques to mitigate the impact of continuous operations on Soldiers.\\nSegregation of Soldiers by Shift\\n11-49. Sleep and living areas for Soldiers should be segregated by the shifts worked. This minimizes sleep\\ndisruptions caused by waking activities of those working other shifts.\\nExtra Time for Night Workers and Day Sleepers\\n11-50. The circadian rhythm of alertness works against daytime sleep and nighttime alertness. Soldiers\\nworking a night shift typically require more time to successfully complete tasks because they work slower or\\nless efficiently. These Soldiers also tend to accrue sleep debt faster than those working on normal day shifts.\\nExtra Monitoring on the Night Shift\\n11-51. Soldiers engaged in mission- and/or safety-critical tasks during the descending phase of the circadian\\nrhythm of alertness (between 2300 and 0800) can benefit from enhanced oversight and monitoring. During\\nthese times, when Soldier alertness is compromised, there is an increased risk of lapses in attention and even\\nbrief, uncontrolled sleep episodes (microsleep).\\nOff-duty Safety\\n11-52. Following nighttime work, the morning commute back home can be a time of significantly increased\\nrisk. For example, ending staff duty or charge of quarters during the early morning hours (around 0700) can\\nput sleep-deprived Soldiers behind the steering wheel at a point in the circadian rhythm of alertness when\\nthey are at greatest risk for vehicle accidents. Providing post-shift sleeping quarters, scheduling night shifts\\nto end during the ascending phase of the circadian rhythm of alertness (after 0900 hours), or providing post-\\nshift transportation home can help improve the safety of Soldiers working the night shift.\\nDe-conflicting Schedules\\n11-53. Commands should schedule required briefings and dining facility availability so as to minimize\\npotential conflicts with the daytime sleep of Soldiers on duty during the nighttime. No Soldier should have\\nto choose between food and sleep.\\nSleep Prioritization\\n11-54. The restorative effects of sleep accrue primarily to the brain and are primarily manifested as\\nimproved cognitive performance. Accordingly, it is especially important that leaders and others engaged in\\nhigher-order cognitive tasks\u2014such as mission planning, decision making, risk assessment, and problem\\nsolving\u2014are afforded and take full advantage of opportunities to obtain adequate sleep.\\nINTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE AND SUSTAIN READINESS\\n11-55. Depending on the situation, leaders can implement certain interventions to sustain or improve\\nSoldier readiness by limiting the causes of loss of alertness and results of sleep deprivation. Leaders can use\\nmany of these methods singularly or in combination with other interventions as practicable.\\nNAPS\\n11-56. When regular nighttime sleep is not possible due to mission requirements, Soldiers can use short,\\ninfrequent naps to restore wakefulness and promote performance. When routinely available sleep time is\\ndifficult to predict, Soldiers might take the longest nap possible as frequently as time is available. During\\nperiods of restricted sleep (6 hours of sleep or less per night), napping combined with appropriate doses of\\ncaffeine may help to sustain cognitive performance and alertness.\\n11-10 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Sleep Readiness\\nREST BREAKS (WITHOUT SLEEP)\\n11-57. In addition to varying as a function of sleep loss and the circadian rhythm of alertness, performance\\nalso varies as a function of time-on-task. This effect\u2014the tendency for performance on a continuously\\nperformed task to decline across time\u2014is especially apparent on tasks requiring a lot of mental energy or\\nextended vigilance, and it is reversed by simple time-off-task (rest). Time-on-task effects interact with (are\\nexacerbated by) sleepiness. Therefore, when Soldiers perform such tasks under conditions of sleep loss or\\nduring the descending phase of the circadian rhythm of alertness, leaders can expect Soldiers will need more\\nfrequent and/or longer rest breaks. Although rest breaks reverse that portion of the performance deficit caused\\nby time-on-task, such breaks do not reverse deficits associated with sleepiness per se (unless, of course,\\nSoldiers get some sleep during the rest break). Sleep loss effects and time-on-task effects interactively impair\\nperformance but require different interventions.\\nREVERSE PHYSICAL TRAINING SCHEDULE\\n11-58. When it is feasible, this strategy\u2014a delayed start time to the duty day with afternoon as opposed to\\nmorning physical training sessions\u2014has two benefits. First, it conforms well to the brain\u2019s natural circadian\\nrhythm of alertness. Second, it results in longer sleep durations, especially in younger Soldiers who almost\\ninvariably use a later wake time to obtain more sleep. When implemented, this schedule can result in reduced\\nutilization of sick call and reduced accident rates.\\nCAFFEINE TO SUSTAIN ALERTNESS AND PERFORMANCE\\n11-59. Table 11-2 summarizes the caffeine doses for optimal alertness under different sleep challenges.\\nTable 11-2. Caffeine dose for optimal alertness\\nType of sleep challenge Dose\\nSustained operations \\uf0b7 200 mg at midnight\\n\\uf0b7 200 mg again at 0400 and 0800 if needed\\n\\uf0b7 Use during daytime (1200 and 1600) only if needed\\nNight operations with daytime sleep \\uf0b7 200 mg at start of night shift\\n\\uf0b7 200 mg again 4 hours later\\n\\uf0b7 Late dose: at least 6 hours prior to start of daytime sleep\\nRestricted sleep (6 hours of sleep) \\uf0b7 200 mg upon awakening\\n\\uf0b7 200 mg again 4 hours later\\n\\uf0b7 Last dose: at least 6 hours prior to sleep period\\nmg milligram\\nCaffeine Dose (200 milligrams)\\n11-60. For many missions some degree of sleep loss is unavoidable. In these cases, Soldiers may best\\naccomplish short-term sustainment of alertness and performance with judicious use of a non-sleep (stimulant)\\nintervention. For a variety of reasons (including its wide availability, its familiarity to Soldiers, and its relative\\nsafety and effectiveness), caffeine is recommended for this purpose. For most individuals under most\\ncircumstances, the optimal dose of caffeine is 200 milligrams.\\nCaffeine Limitations\\n11-61. Caffeine only temporarily helps restore alertness and performance. It does not replace sleep. Nor\\ndoes it fully restore all the cognitive abilities decremented by sleep loss. In much the same way, caffeine can\\nhelp keep a Soldier from falling asleep, but it does not improve that Soldier\u2019s judgment, coordination, or\\nreaction time. Because it will interfere with the ability to initiate and/or maintain sleep, Soldiers should avoid\\ncaffeine, if consistent with mission requirements, for at least 6 hours prior to an anticipated sleep opportunity.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 11-11Chapter 11\\nBEHAVIORAL FACTORS\\n11-62. In addition to operational requirements, sleep readiness also depends on the behavior of individual\\nSoldiers. The conditions in which Soldiers find themselves, as well as the schedules they maintain or\\nactivities in which they participate, contribute to sleep readiness.\\nExercise\\n11-63. Regular, moderate physical exercise facilitates subsequent nighttime sleep onset and promotes\\ndeeper (more restorative) sleep. However, vigorous exercise immediately prior to bedtime can interfere with\\nsleep for some individuals, especially if that exercise is to exhaustion, producing a physiological stress\\nresponse. During the daytime, short bouts of around 30 minutes of physical activity can result in a moderate\\n3-hour boost of alertness in well-rested Soldiers. Such bouts do little for reversing and sustaining alertness\\nunder conditions of significant sleep loss.\\nDiet\\n11-64. Various foods and food preparation techniques can affect sleep\u2014both positively and negatively.\\nSleep-promoting foods tend to be high in fiber and low in added sugars. High-fat, fried, or spicy foods tend\\nto negatively impact sleep. Such foods tax the stomach, are difficult to digest, and may cause nocturnal\\nesophageal reflux or heartburn. Soldiers should avoid these types of foods prior to bedtime. As a rule, Soldiers\\nshould avoid full, heavy meals within 2\u20133 hours of initiating sleep. However, they should not go to bed\\nhungry either, since hunger can also lighten and disrupt sleep. If Soldiers need to eat just prior to bedtime,\\ntheir best options include a balanced snack or meal that includes fruits; vegetables; whole grains; fat proteins;\\nand foods low in added sugar. Foods that rarely disturb sleep include Greek yogurt or cottage cheese with\\nfruit, peanut butter on whole grain toast, cheese and crackers, milk with a small bowl of whole grain cereal,\\nand protein bars.\\nAlcohol\\n11-65. Although alcohol increases drowsiness and can facilitate sleep onset, it subsequently lightens and\\ndisrupts sleep as the body metabolizes it during the night. It causes multiple arousals and awakenings, thus\\nharming sleep more than it helps. The body metabolizes alcohol at a rate of about one ounce per hour.\\nTherefore, to avoid the negative effects of alcohol on sleep, Soldiers should consume no more than one drink\\none hour before bedtime, no more than two drinks two hours before bedtime, and so on. However, abstinence\\nis the best strategy when a good night of sleep is especially important for next-day activities or missions.\\nSleep Environment\\n11-66. The importance of a sleep-friendly environment cannot be overstated. Living conditions and\\nenvironments vary widely, but leaders can improve most sleep areas with a few simple steps.\\nAmbient Noise\\n11-67. Sleeping quarters should be located as far away from noisy areas (such as airfields, generators, and\\nfueling stations) as possible. The effects of remaining uncontrollable, intermittent, random noises should be\\nmasked with a white noise generator. Finally, Soldiers can wear noise-dampening earplugs to effectively\\nblock noise and improve sleep.\\nPhysical Comfort\\n11-68. Room temperature should be cool, ranging from 65\u201372 \u00baF. Sheets, bed, pillows, sleep surfaces (such\\nas mattresses and cots), and sleeping clothes should be clean and comfortable. Mattresses should be\\nrequisitioned to fit the Soldier.\\nLight\\n11-69. Humans are not nocturnal. Soldiers are hardwired to be active during the day and to sleep at night.\\nThe brain\u2019s internal clock is very sensitive to light, and any amount of light that reaches the brain through\\n11-12 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Sleep Readiness\\nthe eyes at night can be harmful. Even dim lights emitted from electronics such as a smart phone, computer,\\nor television can have a negative impact. This light confuses and resets the brain\u2019s internal clock, which can\\nmisinterpret such light exposures as either an early dawn or a late dusk. In either case, such exposures\\nincrementally weaken the brain\u2019s circadian rhythm of alertness, negatively impacting both nighttime sleep\\nand daytime alertness. Therefore, sleeping areas should be kept dark. Blackout curtains or blinds should cover\\nall windows. Leaders need to strictly enforce the lights out policies. To improve Soldiers\u2019 ability to avoid\\nunwanted light exposure and thus facilitate sleep, leaders should create separate sleep areas for each shift and\\nencourage the use of comfortable sleep masks.\\nSafety\\n11-70. Operational or training environments should be safe and secure for Soldiers to sleep in. This also\\napplies to areas where Soldiers take naps. Ensure that Soldiers do not attempt to nap in front of, behind, or\\nunderneath trucks, tracked vehicles, or other vehicles. Soldiers need to avoid and protect against pests (for\\nexample, use mosquito nets when appropriate). Before sleeping, Solders check that snakes, spiders, ants, and\\nother creatures are not in the sleeping area, sleeping bag, or shoes.\\nSLEEP MANAGEMENT PLANNING TOOL: 2B-ALERT WEB\\n11-71. Leaders have a planning decision aid to help plan missions and predict the effects of any sleep-wake\\nschedule on performance. This scientifically-developed mission planning decision aid, the 2B-Alert Web, is\\navailable at http://sleep.bhsai.org. This tool can predict the effects of any sleep-wake schedule on vigilance\\nperformance, as well as the efficacy of applying both naps and caffeine as fatigue countermeasures at any\\npoint during a mission.\\nRESOURCES\\n11-72. Everyone occasionally experiences difficulty sleeping. Such difficulties may be due to anxiety,\\nexcitement, physical exhaustion or discomfort, travel across multiple time zones, or overuse of caffeine.\\nUsually, such sleep difficulties are situational and temporary. They easily resolve with time, a change in the\\nsituation, or good sleep hygiene practices. For example, a high operational tempo may be stressful and allow\\nlittle time for sleep, or allow for sleep only during the ascending phase of the circadian rhythm of alertness\\n(for example, the daytime) when the brain\u2019s clock promotes wakefulness. However, as the operational tempo\\nslows and Soldiers reestablish nighttime sleep opportunities, sleep problems will typically resolve.\\n11-73. Sometimes, however, sleep problems are more persistent and difficult to address. For example, some\\nindividuals are able to fall asleep easily at night but then experience early morning awakenings with difficulty\\nreturning to sleep. Others persistently experience difficulty initiating sleep at night and awakening when they\\nneed to in the morning. The discussion beginning in paragraph 11-74 provides some self-management\\nstrategies Soldiers can use to address these relatively persistent sleep problems.\\nSLEEP PROBLEMS\\n11-74. When Soldiers experience persistent sleep problems despite generally good sleep habits and an\\nadequate sleep environment, a more concerted effort to improve sleep is warranted. First, Soldiers must\\nevaluate their sleep habits and sleep environment.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 11-13Chapter 11\\n11-75. For those who persistently experience difficulty falling asleep, the following suggestions and\\ntechniques may prove helpful:\\n\\uf06c Establish a very regular and relaxing pre-sleep routine.\\n\\uf06c Practice self-regulation activities such as relaxation exercises and guided meditations. DOD and\\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs developed available applications, and the Human Performance\\nResources by CHAMPS (https://www.hprc-online.org/) has various self-regulation activities:\\n\\uf0a7 Visualization or guided imagery exercises.\\n\\uf0a7 Meditation or mindfulness exercises.\\n\\uf0a7 Mental focusing exercises.\\n\\uf06c Use an app. There are hundreds of apps for sleep and relaxation, which may help Soldiers fall\\nasleep and track sleep.\\nWHEN TO SEEK EXPERT HELP\\n11-76. Soldiers should schedule appointments with healthcare providers if they have persistent daytime\\nsleepiness, difficulty staying asleep, difficulty falling sleep, or disturbance of a sleeping partner with snoring\\nand/or gasping at night.\\nSleep Readiness\\nSoldiers should sleep as much as they can, whenever they can, as the situation allows.\\nThe vast majority of Soldiers require 7-8 hours of sleep per night to sustain\\nperformance; more sleep is better. Soldiers can maximize sleep and subsequent\\nperformance by timing sleep and caffeine use optimally. Finally, only sleep replaces\\nlost sleep.\\n11-14 FM 7-22 1 October 2020Chapter 12\\nSpecial Conditioning\\nPrograms for Soldiers who are having difficulty meeting Army standards are part of\\nspecial conditioning. These programs are not punitive. They are restorative. Their\\npurpose is to build readiness so that Soldiers return to full duty and deploy in support\\nof any mission. They include training and testing improvement, ABCP, reconditioning\\nafter completing rehabilitation for an injury or illness, and pregnancy and postpartum\\nphysical training (P3T).\\nREHABILITATION AND RECONDITIONING PROGRAM\\n12-1. Army leaders prioritize the health and well-being of Soldiers. The focus of H2F System is the physical,\\npsychological, and social well-being of the Soldier. This integrated approach includes those who are rallying\\nback to optimal readiness after a period of illness, injury, or deconditioning. Operational unit leaders and\\nsustaining phase leaders have a responsibility to communicate clearly with their medical counterparts in the\\nMilitary Healthcare System when helping Soldiers through these conditions. The H2F personnel in the unit\\ncan perform this function as well and will be the primary leaders of the unit\u2019s special programs.\\n12-2. Illness occurs when Soldiers deviate from a healthy state and feel helpless, dependent, and continuous\\ndiscomfort. It leads to a narrowing of focus and goals and an increase in concern about pain. Illness differs\\nfrom disease: a Soldier can feel ill but not have a disease. An illness is a state where a Soldier has feeling of\\npain or discomfort that may or may not have an identified cause. A disease might not have symptoms of pain\\nor discomfort, but it will have an identified cause\u2014a pathology or diagnosis\u2014that causes the body or parts\\nof the body to not work properly. Whether real or perceived, the physical and psychological responses of the\\nbody to illness or disease is stress. When this type of stress is overlaid on daily hassles, major life events, or\\nhigh operational tempo, Army leaders use the H2F System to mitigate the impact on the Soldier and the unit\u2019s\\nreadiness.\\n12-3. Rehabilitation and reconditioning both depend on the unit\u2019s conditioning program. If leaders do not\\nsynchronize the rehabilitation and reconditioning program with the conditioning program, the Soldier is at\\nincreased risk for chronic injury or re-injury. Exercises and drills for rehabilitation and reconditioning are\\nbased upon the conditioning program. Profiles describe which exercises, drills, and activities can be done to\\nstandard, must be modified, or cannot be performed\u2014are restricted. If the conditioning program changes, or\\nother physical activity is included in the H2F program, then leaders need to consider the impact on the\\nrehabilitation and reconditioning programs and the profile system.\\nREHABILITATION\\n12-4. Rehabilitation is a program developed and overseen by medical providers that Soldiers begin soon\\nafter becoming ill or injured. Rehabilitation aims to return the Soldier to a baseline of physical function in\\ndaily activities such as personal hygiene and mobility at home and work. Once Soldiers reach this goal, they\\nmay progress to higher levels of function under the direct supervision of a medical provider. When Soldiers\\nreach rehabilitation goals, the provider can discharge them to full duty or change their profiles so they can\\nstart reconditioning.\\n12-5. Soldiers may continue rehabilitation, reconditioning, or both until returned to readiness for return to\\nfull duty. Healthcare providers should communicate with H2F personnel to allow the Soldier to safely train\\nin the reconditioning program. They may remain on profile during this period.\\n1 October 2020 FM 7-22 12-1Chapter 12\\nRECONDITIONING\\n12-6. Reconditioning is unit-owned. Reconditioning is a unit-driven and unit-run physical readiness training\\nprogram for Soldiers who are deconditioned due to illness or injury, are new to the unit, or deconditioned\\ndue to deployment or other circumstances. Soldiers who have completed rehabilitation and been given\\npermanent profile restrictions may be appropriate for certain reconditioning program elements. All Soldiers\\nwill have progressed in their recovery to the point where they can safely train without the direct supervision\\nof a healthcare provider or communication between the medical provider and H2F personnel will allow the\\nSoldier to safely train in the reconditioning program. Reconditioning returns Soldiers safely and as soon as\\npossible to full duty.\\n12-7. In the H2F System, reconditioning drills and exercises provide a standard for Soldiers and units to\\nfollow no matter their circumstances. With the H2F System, units can individualize the reconditioning\\nprogram. H2F trainers and healthcare providers in the unit aim to provide early identification and treatment\\nof injuries and to prevent injuries from happening in the first place\u2014so-called primary injury. When units\\nreceive H2F personnel, Soldiers will manage fewer injuries themselves. That means primary injury control\\napproaches initially increase in rate and number of injuries since these personnel now identify, diagnose,\\nrecord, and treat the injuries. While this increased injury rate surprises some leaders, it is a typical occurrence.\\nAs leaders implement the H2F System\u2014with proper conditioning program and earlier access to treatment\u2014\\nthe unit controls the number of injuries at lower rates or less severe conditions. The expert advice stops\\nchronic or more serious injuries from developing. Those units that continue with non-standardized, random,\\nnon-periodized training often continue to have a greater need for reconditioning programs.\\nTRAINING AND TESTING IMPROVEMENT\\n12-8. When Soldiers fail to meet unit goals, leaders consider many factors that may contribute to these\\nfailures, including physical, psychological, and social areas. These factors may include transitioning from\\ndeployed status, time available to train, participation in H2F programming, family issues, increased stress\\nfrom external factors, and recovery from illness or injury.\\nTime in Training\\n12-9. Soldiers who just arrived from IMT or just completed professional military education, prolonged\\ndeployment, or remote assignment may perform at or below the minimum unit standard or the baseline for\\nthe ACFT. They may be deconditioned or overweight. They may fail to keep up with the pace of other\\nSoldiers in the gaining unit. In the face of new physical and psychological stress, they may require several\\nmonths to acclimate to the unit\u2019s culture and to acclimatize to the altitude or weather at the new location. An\\neffective leader provides Soldiers training programs specific to their needs to transition them to optimal\\nreadiness.\\nRegular Participation\\n12-10. Many factors influence regular participation in H2F sessions. The most common factor is operational\\ntempo and related mission requirements. Leaders must anticipate and plan for these and must make H2F\\nreadiness training as important as any other programmed training, even if that means inserting it later in the\\nmorning or afternoon.
