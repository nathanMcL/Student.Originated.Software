## What is Ai Self-Hosting?

AI self-hosting refers to the capability to run AI models on your own infrastructure rather than relying on cloud-based services.<br>
This can involve setting up the necessary hardware and software to train and run AI models locally.<br>
The process is autonomous to an extent but is heavily guided by the initial programming and ongoing training provided by human operators.

When I think about AI, particularly in the context of generating responses to user queries, we're often discussing models trained on large datasets that learn to predict the most likely response based on the input they receive. These AI models, like GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer), use statistical probabilities to generate responses that are coherent and contextually relevant to the queries they receive.<br>

## 4/16/2024
added prototype-00. ' -00 ' is a current build from Ai-selfhosting course. 
I ran both prototypes within gitpod. Once I executed the first prototype the training files then unzip within the directory. which I thought was fine, I had created a .gitignore file.<br>
I was unable to commit and push my changes after I ran the prototypes.<br>
