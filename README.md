Welcome to my Student Originated Software repository. <br>
This repository is a collection of utility tools designed to collect and manipulate data, do simple calculations, and a neglected blog ...<br>


## Software Programs

### System Performance Logging Program

`SystemLog.sh` to `MenuMode.py`

This program collects data using a bash script tailored for Debian/Linux systems.<br>
The script is used to monitor and log system performance metrics in csv format.<br>
The script provides insights into:<br>

- Computer Temperature
- Wi-Fi Quality
- Computer Usage
- Memory Usage
- Disk Usage
- Network Traffic Usage

### Traceroute Program

`TraceRoute_Script.py`

This Python program is a tool for network analysis. <br>
It performs traceroute operations to a specified destination and logs important metrics including:<br>

- **Hour**: The exact time when the traceroute was performed.
- **Destination**: The target IP or domain of the traceroute.
- **Number of Routers Passed**: Counts the number of hops to reach the destination.
- **Average Delay**: Calculates the mean time taken for the packets to reach the destination and return.
- **Standard Deviation**: Measures the variability in the delay experienced by the packets.

### Caculator App

`Calculator_app/`

This is a standard calculator app designed from inspecting my courseware resource.<br>
The calculator is based off a standard calculator written with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS<br>
It features a clean interface and supports basic arithmetic operations.<br>

- **Simple Design**: Easy to navigate interface for users.
